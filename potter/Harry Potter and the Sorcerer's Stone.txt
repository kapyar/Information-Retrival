1. THE BOY WHO LIVED


Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people youíd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didnít hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didnít think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursleyís sister, but they hadnít met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didnít have a sister, because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didnít want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.

ìLittle tyke,î chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number fourís drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiaróa cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didnít realize what he had seenóthen he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasnít a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Driveóno, looking at the sign; cats couldnít read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldnít help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldnít bear people who dressed in funny clothesóthe getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werenít young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stuntóthese people were obviously collecting for somethingÖ yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadnít, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didnít see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought heíd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

Heíd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakerís. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didnít know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldnít see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.

ìThe Potters, thatís right, thatís what I heardóî

ìóyes, their son, Harryóî

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinkingÖ no, he was being stupid. Potter wasnít such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasnít even sure his nephew was called Harry. Heíd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didnít blame heróif heíd had a sister like thatÖ but all the same, those people in cloaksÖ

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oíclock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.

ìSorry,î he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didnít seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, ìDonít be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!î

And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didnít approve of imagination.

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he sawóand it didnít improve his moodówas the tabby cat heíd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.

ìShoo!î said Mr. Dursley loudly.

The cat didnít move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Doorís problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (ìWonít!î). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:

ìAnd finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nationís owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.î The newscaster allowed himself a grin. ìMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?î

ìWell, Ted,î said the weatherman, ìI donít know about that, but itís not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, theyíve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night earlyóitís not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.î

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the PottersÖ

Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. Heíd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. ìEróPetunia, dearóyou havenít heard from your sister lately, have you?î

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didnít have a sister.

ìNo,î she said sharply. ìWhy?î

ìFunny stuff on the news,î Mr. Dursley mumbled. ìOwlsÖ shooting starsÖ and there were a lot of funny looking people in town todayÖî

ìSo?î snapped Mrs. Dursley.

ìWell, I just thoughtÖ maybeÖ it was something to do withÖ you knowÖ her crowd.î

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her heíd heard the name ìPotter.î He decided he didnít dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, ìTheir sonóheíd be about Dudleyís age now, wouldnít he?î

ìI suppose so,î said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

ìWhatís his name again? Howard, isnít it?î

ìHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.î

ìOh, yes,î said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ìYes, I quite agree.î

He didnít say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.

Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it didÖ if it got out that they were related to a pair ofówell, he didnít think he could bear it.

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kindÖ He couldnít see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going onóhe yawned and turned overóit couldnít affect themÖ

How very wrong he was.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didnít so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently youíd have thought heíd just popped out of the ground. The catís tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This manís name was Albus Dumbledore.

Albus Dumbledore didnít seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, ìI should have known.î

He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it againóthe next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldnít be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didnít look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.

ìFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.î

He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.

ìHow did you know it was me?î she asked.

ìMy dear Professor, Iíve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.î

ìYouíd be stiff if youíd been sitting on a brick wall all day,î said Professor McGonagall.

ìAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.î

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

ìOh yes, everyoneís celebrating, all right,î she said impatiently. ìYouíd think theyíd be a bit more careful, but noóeven the Muggles have noticed somethingís going on. It was on their news.î She jerked her head back at the Dursleysí dark living room window. ìI heard it. Flocks of owlsÖ shooting starsÖ Well, theyíre not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in KentóIíll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.î

ìYou canít blame them,î said Dumbledore gently. ìWeíve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.î

ìI know that,î said Professor McGonagall irritably. ìBut thatís no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.î

She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didnít, so she went on. ìA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?î

ìIt certainly seems so,î said Dumbledore. ìWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?î

ìA what?î

ìA lemon drop. Theyíre a kind of Muggle sweet Iím rather fond of.î

ìNo, thank you,î said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didnít think this was the moment for lemon drops. ìAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has goneóî

ìMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ëYou-Know-Whoí nonsenseófor eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.î Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. ìIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying ëYou-Know-Who.í I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemortís name.î

ìI know you havenítî, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. ìBut youíre different. Everyone knows youíre the only one You Knowóoh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.î

ìYou flatter me,î said Dumbledore calmly. ìVoldemort had powers I will never have.î

ìOnly because youíre tooówellónoble to use them.î

ìItís lucky itís dark. I havenít blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.î

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, ìThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyoneís saying? About why heís disappeared? About what finally stopped him?î

It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ìeveryoneî was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.

ìWhat theyíresaying,î she pressed on, ìis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godricís Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter areóareóthat theyíreódead.î

Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

ìLily and JamesÖ I canít believe itÖ I didnít want to believe itÖ Oh, AlbusÖî

Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ìI knowÖ I knowÖî he said heavily.

Professor McGonagallís voice trembled as she went on. ìThatís not all. Theyíre saying he tried to kill the Potterís son, Harry. Butóhe couldnít. He couldnít kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but theyíre saying that when he couldnít kill Harry Potter, Voldemortís power somehow brokeóand thatís why heís gone.î

Dumbledore nodded glumly.

ìItísóitís true?î faltered Professor McGonagall. ìAfter all heís doneÖ all the people heís killedÖ he couldnít kill a little boy? Itís just astoundingÖ of all the things to stop himÖ but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?î

ìWe can only guess,î said Dumbledore. ìWe may never know.î

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, ìHagridís late. I suppose it was he who told you Iíd be here, by the way?î

ìYes,î said Professor McGonagall. ìAnd I donít suppose youíre going to tell me why youíre here, of all places?î

ìIíve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. Theyíre the only family he has left now.î

ìYou donít meanóyou canít mean the people who live here?î cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. ìDumbledoreóyou canít. Iíve been watching them all day. You couldnít find two people who are less like us. And theyíve got this sonóI saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!î

ìItís the best place for him,î said Dumbledore firmly. ìHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when heís older. Iíve written them a letter.î

ìA letter?î repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. ìReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! Heíll be famousóa legendóI wouldnít be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the futureóthere will be books written about Harryóevery child in our world will know his name!î

ìExactly,î said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. ìIt would be enough to turn any boyís head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he wonít even remember! Canít you see how much better off heíll be, growing up away from all that until heís ready to take it?î

Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, ìYesóyes, youíre right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?î She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

ìHagridís bringing him.î

ìYou think itówiseóto trust Hagrid with something as important as this?î

ìI would trust Hagrid with my life,î said Dumbledore.

ìIím not saying his heart isnít in the right place,î said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ìbut you canít pretend heís not careless. He does tend toówhat was that?î

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the skyóand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wildólong tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.

ìHagrid,î said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ìAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?î

ìBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,î said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. ìYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. Iíve got him, sir.î

ìNo problems, were there?î

ìNo, siróhouse was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarminí around. He fell asleep as we was flyiní over Bristol.î

Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

ìIs that whereó?î whispered Professor McGonagall.

ìYes,î said Dumbledore. ìHeíll have that scar forever.î

ìCouldnít you do something about it, Dumbledore?î

ìEven if I could, I wouldnít. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Wellógive him here, Hagridóweíd better get this over with.î

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleysí house.

ìCould Iócould I say good bye to him, sir?î asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.

ìShhh!î hissed Professor McGonagall, ìyouíll wake the Muggles!î

ìS-s-sorry,î sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. ìBut I c-c-canít stand itóLily aní James deadóaní poor little Harry off ter live with Mugglesóî

ìYes, yes, itís all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or weíll be found,î Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harryís blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagridís shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledoreís eyes seemed to have gone out.

ìWell,î said Dumbledore finally, ìthatís that. Weíve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.î

ìYeah,î said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, ìIíll be takiní Sirius his bike back. Gínight, Professor McGonagallóProfessor Dumbledore, sir.î

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.

ìI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,î said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

ìGood luck, Harry,î he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hoursí time by Mrs. Dursleyís scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin DudleyÖ He couldnít know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: ìTo Harry Potteróthe boy who lived!î




2. THE VANISHING GLASS


Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleysí front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnetsóbut Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.

ìUp! Get up! Now!î

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.

ìUp!î she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling heíd had the same dream before.

His aunt was back outside the door.

ìAre you up yet?î she demanded.

ìNearly,î said Harry.

ìWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And donít you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddyís birthday.î

Harry groaned.

ìWhat did you say?î his aunt snapped through the door.

ìNothing, nothingÖî

Dudleyís birthdayóhow could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudleyís birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exerciseóunless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudleyís favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldnít often catch him. Harry didnít look it, but he was very fast.

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudleyís, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

ìIn the car crash when your parents died,î she had said. ìAnd donít ask questions.î

Donít ask questionsóthat was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.

ìComb your hair!î he barked, by way of a morning greeting.

About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that wayóall over the place.

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angelóHarry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasnít much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.

ìThirty six,î he said, looking up at his mother and father. ìThatís two less than last year.î

ìDarling, you havenít counted Auntie Margeís present, see, itís here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.î

ìAll right, thirty seven then,î said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.

Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, ìAnd weíll buy you another two presents while weíre out today. Howís that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?î

Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, ìSo Iíll have thirty Ö thirtyÖî

ìThirty nine, sweetums,î said Aunt Petunia.

ìOh.î Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. ìAll right then.î

Uncle Vernon chuckled. ìLittle tyke wants his moneyís worth, just like his father. íAtta boy, Dudley!î He ruffled Dudleyís hair.

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.

ìBad news, Vernon,î she said. ìMrs. Figgís broken her leg. She canít take him.î She jerked her head in Harryís direction.

Dudleyís mouth fell open in horror, but Harryís heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudleyís birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats sheíd ever owned.

ìNow what?î said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though heíd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasnít easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.

ìWe could phone Marge,î Uncle Vernon suggested.

ìDonít be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.î

The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasnít thereóor rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldnít understand them, like a slug.

ìWhat about whatís her name, your friendóYvonne?î

ìOn vacation in Majorca,î snapped Aunt Petunia.

ìYou could just leave me here,î Harry put in hopefully (heíd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudleyís computer).

Aunt Petunia looked as though sheíd just swallowed a lemon.

ìAnd come back and find the house in ruins?î she snarled.

ìI wonít blow up the house,î said Harry, but they werenít listening.

ìI suppose we could take him to the zoo,î said Aunt Petunia slowly, ìÖand leave him in the carÖî

ìThat carís new, heís not sitting in it aloneÖî

Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasnít really cryingóit had been years since heíd really criedóbut he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.

ìDinky Duddydums, donít cry, Mummy wonít let him spoil your special day!î she cried, flinging her arms around him.

ìIÖ donítÖ wantÖ himÖ t-t-to come!î Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. ìHe always sp-spoils everything!î He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his motherís arms.

Just then, the doorbell rangóìOh, good Lord, theyíre here!î said Aunt Petunia franticallyóand a moment later, Dudleyís best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held peopleís arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldnít believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleysí car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadnít been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before theyíd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.

ìIím warning you,î he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harryís, ìIím warning you now, boyóany funny business, anything at allóand youíll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.î

ìIím not going to do anything,î said Harry, ìhonestlyÖî

But Uncle Vernon didnít believe him. No one ever did.

The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didnít make them happen.

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnít been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left ìto hide that horrible scar.î Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldnít explain how it had grown back so quickly.

Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudleyís (brown with orange puff balls)óThe harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldnít fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasnít punished.

On the other hand, heíd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudleyís gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harryís surprise as anyone elseís, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harryís headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all heíd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.

But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnít school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figgís cabbage smelling living room.

While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.

ìÖroaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,î he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.

ìI had a dream about a motorcycle,î said Harry, remembering suddenly. ìIt was flying.î

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: ìMOTORCYCLES DONíT FLY!î

Dudley and Piers sniggered.

ìI know they donít,î said Harry. ìIt was only a dream.î

But he wished he hadnít said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnít, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoonóthey seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasnít bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasnít blond.

Harry had the best morning heíd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldnít fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnít have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.

After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernonís car and crushed it into a trash canóbut at the moment it didnít look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.

Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.

ìMake it move,î he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didnít budge.

ìDo it again,î Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.

ìThis is boring,î Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldnít have been surprised if it had died of boredom itselfóno company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harryís.

It winked.

Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They werenít. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.

The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:

ìI get that all the time.î

ìI know,î Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasnít sure the snake could hear him. ìIt must be really annoying.î

The snake nodded vigorously.

ìWhere do you come from, anyway?î Harry asked.

The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.



Boa Constrictor, Brazil.


ìWas it nice there?î

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. ìOh, I seeóso youíve never been to Brazil?î

As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.

ìDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WONíT BELIEVE WHAT ITíS DOING!î

Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.

ìOut of the way, you,î he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happenedóone second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictorís tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.

As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, ìBrazil, here I comeÖ Thanksss, amigo.î

The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.

ìBut the glass,î he kept saying, ìwhere did the glass go?î

The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadnít done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernonís car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, ìHarry was talking to it, werenít you, Harry?î

Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, ìGoócupboardóstayóno meals,î before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.

Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didnít know what time it was and he couldnít be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldnít risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.

Heíd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since heíd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldnít remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldnít imagine where all the green light came from. He couldnít remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.

At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudleyís gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudleyís gang.




3. THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE


The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.

Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudleyís gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudleyís favorite sport: Harry Hunting.

This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldnít be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernonís old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.

ìThey stuff peopleís heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,î he told Harry. ìWant to come upstairs and practice?î

ìNo, thanks,î said Harry. ìThe poor toiletís never had anything as horrible as your head down itóit might be sick.î Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what heíd said.

One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figgís. Mrs. Figg wasnít as bad as usual. It turned out sheíd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didnít seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though sheíd had it for several years.

That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltingsí boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers werenít looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.

As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldnít believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didnít trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.


* * *

There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.

ìWhatís this?î he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.

ìYour new school uniform,î she said.

Harry looked in the bowl again.

ìOh,î he said, ìI didnít realize it had to be so wet.î

ìDonít be stupid,î snapped Aunt Petunia. ìIím dyeing some of Dudleyís old things gray for you. Itíll look just like everyone elseís when Iíve finished.î

Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall Highólike he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.

Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harryís new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.

They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.

ìGet the mail, Dudley,î said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.

ìMake Harry get it.î

ìGet the mail, Harry.î

ìMake Dudley get it.î

ìPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.î

Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernonís sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, andóa letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relativesóhe didnít belong to the library, so heíd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:



Mr. H. Potter

The Cupboard under the Stairs

4 Privet Drive

Little Whinging

Surrey


The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.

Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.

ìHurry up, boy!î shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. ìWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?î He chuckled at his own joke.

Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.

Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.

ìMargeís ill,î he informed Aunt Petunia. ìAte a funny whelk.î

ìDad!î said Dudley suddenly. ìDad, Harryís got something!î

Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.

ìThatís mine!î said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

ìWhoíd be writing to you?î sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didnít stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.

ìP-P-Petunia!î he gasped.

Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.

ìVernon! Oh my goodnessóVernon!î

They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasnít used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.

ìI want to read that letter,î he said loudly.

ìI want to read it,î said Harry furiously, ìas itís mine.î

ìGet out, both of you,î croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.

Harry didnít move.

ìI WANT MY LETTER!î he shouted.

ìLet me see it!î demanded Dudley.

ìOUT!î roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.

ìVernon,î Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, ìlook at the addressóhow could they possibly know where he sleeps? You donít think theyíre watching the house?î

ìWatchingóspyingómight be following us,î muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.

ìBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we donít wantóî

Harry could see Uncle Vernonís shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.

ìNo,î he said finally. ìNo, weíll ignore it. If they donít get an answerÖ Yes, thatís bestÖ we wonít do anythingÖî

ìButóî

ìIím not having one in the house, Petunia! Didnít we swear when we took him in weíd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?î

That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something heíd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.

ìWhereís my letter?î said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. ìWhoís writing to me?î

ìNo one. it was addressed to you by mistake,î said Uncle Vernon shortly. ìI have burned it.î

ìIt was not a mistake,î said Harry angrily, ìit had my cupboard on it.î

ìSILENCE!î yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.

ìEróyes, Harryóabout this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinkingÖ youíre really getting a bit big for itÖ we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudleyís second bedroom.î

ìWhy?î said Harry.

ìDonít ask questions!î snapped his uncle. ìTake this stuff upstairs, now.î

The Dursleysí house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernonís sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnít fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighborís dog; in the corner was Dudleyís first ever television set, which heíd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though theyíd never been touched.

From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, ìI donít want him in thereÖ I need that roomÖ make him get outÖî

Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday heíd have given anything to be up here. Today heíd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.

Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. Heíd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didnít have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing heíd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.

When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, ìThereís another one! ëMr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Driveóíî

With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harryís letter clutched in his hand.

ìGo to your cupboardóI mean, your bedroom,î he wheezed at Harry. ìDudleyógoójust go.î

Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnít received his first letter. Surely that meant theyíd try again? And this time heíd make sure they didnít fail. He had a plan.

The repaired alarm clock rang at six oíclock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustnít wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.

He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front dooró

ìAAAAARRRGH!î

Harry leapt into the air; heíd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormatósomething alive!

Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncleís face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didnít do exactly what heíd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernonís lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.

ìI wantóî he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.

Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.

ìSee,î he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, ìif they canít deliver them theyíll just give up.î

ìIím not sure thatíll work, Vernon.î

ìOh, these peopleís minds work in strange ways, Petunia, theyíre not like you and me,î said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.

On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldnít go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.

Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed ìTiptoe Through the Tulipsî as he worked, and jumped at small noises.

On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.

ìWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?î Dudley asked Harry in amazement.


* * *

On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.

ìNo post on Sundays,î he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, ìno damn letters todayóî

Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch oneó

ìOut! OUT!î

Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.

ìThat does it,î said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. ìI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. Weíre going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!î

He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.

They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didnít dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.

ìShake íem offÖ shake íem off,î he would mutter whenever he did this.

They didnít stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. Heíd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, heíd missed five television programs heíd wanted to see, and heíd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wonderingÖ

They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.

ìíScuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an íundred of these at the front desk.î

She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:



Mr. H. Potter

Room 17

Railview Hotel

Cokeworth


Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.

ìIíll take them,î said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.


* * *

ìWouldnít it be better just to go home, dear?î Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didnít seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.

ìDaddyís gone mad, hasnít he?î Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.

ìItís Monday,î he told his mother. ìThe Great Humbertoís on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.î

Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Mondayóand you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of televisionóthen tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harryís eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly funólast year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernonís old socks. Still, you werenít eleven every day.

Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didnít answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what heíd bought.

ìFound the perfect place!î he said. ìCome on! Everyone out!î

It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

ìStorm forecast for tonight!î said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. ìAnd this gentlemanís kindly agreed to lend us his boat!î

A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.

ìIíve already got us some rations,î said Uncle Vernon, ìso all aboard!î

It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house.

The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.

Uncle Vernonís rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

ìCould do with some of those letters now, eh?î he said cheerfully.

He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didnít cheer him up at all.

As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.

The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldnít sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudleyís snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudleyís watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry heíd be eleven in ten minutesí time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.

Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasnít going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that heíd be able to steal one somehow.

Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?

One minute to go and heíd be eleven. Thirty secondsÖ twentyÖ tenÖ nineómaybe heíd wake Dudley up, just to annoy himóthreeÖ twoÖ oneÖ

BOOM.

The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.




4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS


BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. ìWhereís the cannon?î he said stupidly.

There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his handsónow they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.

ìWhoís there?î he shouted. ìI warn youóIím armed!î

There was a pause. Thenó

SMASH!

The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.

A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.

ìCouldnít make us a cup oí tea, could yeh? Itís not been an easy journeyÖî

He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.

ìBudge up, yeh great lump,î said the stranger.

Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.

ìAní hereís Harry!î said the giant.

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.

ìLasí time I saw you, you was only a baby,î said the giant. ìYeh look a lot like yet dad, but yehíve got yet momís eyes.î

Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.

ìI demand that you leave at once, sir!î he said. ìYou are breaking and entering!î

ìAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,î said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernonís hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.

Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.

ìAnywayóHarry,î said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, ìa very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh hereóI mighta sat on it at some point, but itíll taste all right.î

From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.

Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, ìWho are you?î

The giant chuckled.

ìTrue, I havenít introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.î

He held out an enormous hand and shook Harryís whole arm.

ìWhat about that tea then, eh?î he said, rubbing his hands together. ìIíd not say no ter summat stronger if yehíve got it, mind.î

His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldnít see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though heíd sunk into a hot bath.

The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, ìDonít touch anything he gives you, Dudley.î

The giant chuckled darkly.

ìYer great puddiní of a son doní need fatteniní anymore, Dursley, doní worry.î

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldnít take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, ìIím sorry, but I still donít really know who you are.î

The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

ìCall me Hagrid,î he said, ìeveryone does. Aní like I told yeh, Iím Keeper of Keys at Hogwartsóyehíll know all about Hogwarts, oí course.î

ìEróno,î said Harry.

Hagrid looked shocked.

ìSorry,î Harry said quickly.

ìSorry?î barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. ìItí s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh werenít gettiní yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldnít even know abouí Hogwarts, fer cryiní out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?î

ìAll what?î asked Harry.

ìALL WHAT?î Hagrid thundered. ìNow wait jusí one second!î

He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.

ìDo you mean ter tell me,î he growled at the Dursleys, ìthat this boyóthis boy!óknows nothiní abouíóabout ANYTHING?î

Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks werenít bad.

ìI know some things,î he said. ìI can, you know, do math and stuff.î But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, ìAbout our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parentsí world.î

ìWhat world?î

Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.

ìDURSLEY!î he boomed.

Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like ìMimblewimble.î Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.

ìBut yeh must know about yet mom and dad,î he said. ìI mean, theyíre famous. Youíre famous.î

ìWhat? Myómy mom and dad werenít famous, were they?î

ìYeh doní knowÖ yeh doní knowÖî Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.

ìYeh doní know what yeh are?î he said finally.

Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.

ìStop!î he commanded. ìStop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!î

A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.

ìYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! Aní youíve kept it from him all these years?î

ìKept what from me?î said Harry eagerly.

ìSTOP! I FORBID YOU!î yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.

Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.

ìAh, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,î said Hagrid. ìHarryóyer a wizard.î

There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.

ìIím a what?î gasped Harry.

ìA wizard, oí course,î said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, ìaní a thumpiní goodíun, Iíd say, once yehíve been trained up a bit. With a mum aní dad like yours, what else would yeh be? Aní I reckon itís abouí time yeh read yer letter.î

Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut on the Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:



HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY

Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)



Dear Mr. Potter,

We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.

Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall,

Deputy Headmistress


Questions exploded inside Harryís head like fireworks and he couldnít decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, ìWhat does it mean, they await my owl?î

ìGallopiní Gorgons, that reminds me,î said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owlóa real, live, rather ruffled looking owlóa long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:



Dear Professor Dumbledore,

Given Harry his letter.

Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.

Weatherís horrible. Hope youíre well.

Hagrid


Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.

Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.

ìWhere was I?î said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.

ìHeís not going,î he said.

Hagrid grunted.

ìIíd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,î he said.

ìA what?î said Harry, interested.

ìA Muggle,î said Hagrid, ìitís what we call nonmagic folk like them. Aní itís your bad luck you grew up in a family oí the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.î

ìWe swore when we took him in weíd put a stop to that rubbish,î said Uncle Vernon, ìswore weíd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!î

ìYou knew?î said Harry. ìYou knew Iím aóa wizard?î

ìKnew!î shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. ìKnew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to thatóthat schoolóand came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she wasóa freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!î

She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.

ìThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew youíd be just the same, just as strange, just asóasóabnormalóand then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!î

Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, ìBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!î

ìCAR CRASH!î roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. ìHow could a car crash kill Lily aní James Potter? Itís an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowiní his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!î

ìBut why? What happened?î Harry asked urgently.

The anger faded from Hagridís face. He looked suddenly anxious.

ìI never expected this,î he said, in a low, worried voice. ìI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettiní hold of yeh, how much yeh didnít know. Ah, Harry, I doní know if Iím the right person ter tell yehóbut someoneís gottaóyeh canít go off ter Hogwarts not knowiní.î

He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.

ìWell, itís best yeh know as much as I can tell yehómind, I canít tell yeh everythiní, itís a great mystíry, parts of itÖî

He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, ìIt begins, I suppose, withówith a person calledóbut itís incredible yeh donít know his name, everyone in our world knowsóî

ìWho?î

ìWellóI doní like sayiní the name if I can help it. No one does.î

ìWhy not?î

ìGulpiní gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who wentÖ bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name wasÖî

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.

ìCould you write it down?î Harry suggested.

ìNah canít spell it. All rightóVoldemort.î Hagrid shuddered. ìDonít make me say it again. Anyway, thisóthis wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookiní fer followers. Got íem, tooósome were afraid, some just wanted a bit oí his power, ícause he was gettiní himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didnít know who ter trust, didnít dare get friendly with strange wizards or witchesÖ terrible things happened. He was takiní over. íCourse, some stood up to himóaní he killed íem. Horribly. One oí the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledoreís the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didnít dare try takiní the school, not jusí then, anyway.

ìNow, yer mum aní dad were as good a witch aní wizard as I ever knew. Head boy aní girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the mystíry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get íem on his side beforeÖ probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythiní ter do with the Dark Side.

ìMaybe he thought he could persuade íemÖ maybe he just wanted íem outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house aníóaníóî

Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.

ìSorry,î he said. ìBut itís that sadóknew yer mum aní dad, aní nicer people yeh couldnít findóanywayÖî

ìYou-Know-Who killed íem. Aní thenóaní this is the real mystíry of the thingóhe tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killiní by then. But he couldnít do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. Thatís what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yehótook care of yer mum aní dad aní yer house, evenóbut it didnít work on you, aní thatís why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ëem, no one except you, aní heíd killed some oí the best witches aní wizards of the ageóthe McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewettsóaní you was only a baby, aní you lived.î

Something very painful was going on in Harryís mind. As Hagridís story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it beforeóand he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.

Hagrid was watching him sadly.

ìTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledoreís orders. Brought yeh ter this lotÖî

ìLoad of old tosh,î said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.

ìNow, you listen here, boy,î he snarled, ìI accept thereís something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldnít have curedóand as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the worldís better off without them in my opinionóasked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding typesójust what I expected, always knew theyíd come to a sticky endóî

But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, ìIím warning you, DursleyóIím warning youóone more wordÖî

In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernonís courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.

ìThatís better,î said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.

Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.

ìBut what happened to Voló, sorryóI mean, You-Know-Who?î

ìGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. Thatís the biggest mystíry, seeÖ he was gettiní more aní more powerfulówhyíd he go?

ìSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say heís still out there, bidiní his time, like, but I doní believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of íem came outta kinda trances. Doní reckon they couldíve done if he was cominí back.

ìMost of us reckon heís still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. íCause somethiní about you finished him, Harry. There was somethiní goiní on that night he hadnít counted onóI dunno what it was, no one doesóbut somethiní about you stumped him, all right.î

Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? Heíd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadnít they been turned into warty toads every time theyíd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If heíd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?

ìHagrid,î he said quietly, ìI think you must have made a mistake. I donít think I can be a wizard.î

To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.

ìNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?î

Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about itÖ every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angryÖ chased by Dudleyís gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reachÖ dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, heíd managed to make it grow backÖ and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadnít he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadnít he set a boa constrictor on him?

Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.

ìSee?î said Hagrid. ìHarry Potter, not a wizardóyou wait, youíll be right famous at Hogwarts.î

But Uncle Vernon wasnít going to give in without a fight.

ìHavenít I told you heís not going?î he hissed. ìHeís going to Stonewall High and heíll be grateful for it. Iíve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbishóspell books and wands andóî

ìIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you wonít stop him,î growled Hagrid. ìStop Lily aní James Potterís son goiní ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His nameís been down ever since he was born. Heís off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he wonít know himself. Heíll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, aní heíll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbledóî

ìI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!î yelled Uncle Vernon.

But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, ìNEVER,î he thundered, ìóINSULTóALBUSóDUMBLEDOREóINóFRONTóOFóME!î

He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudleyóthere was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pigís tail poking through a hole in his trousers.

Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.

Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.

ìShouldníta lost me temper,î he said ruefully, ìbut it didnít work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnít much left ter do.î

He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.

ìBe grateful if yeh didnít mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,î he said. ìIímóerónot supposed ter do magic, strictly speakiní. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh aní get yer letters to yeh aní stuffóone oí the reasons I was so keen ter take on the jobóî

ìWhy arenít you supposed to do magic?î asked Harry.

ìOh, wellóI was at Hogwarts meself but Ióerógot expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half aní everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.î

ìWhy were you expelled?î

ìItís gettiní late and weíve got lots ter do tomorrow,î said Hagrid loudly. ìGotta get up ter town, get all yer books aní that.î

He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.

ìYou can kip under that,î he said. ìDoní mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple oí dormice in one oí the pockets.î




5. DIAGON ALLEY


Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.

ìIt was a dream, he told himself firmly. ìI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes Iíll be at home in my cupboard.î

There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.

And thereís Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didnít open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

ìAll right,î Harry mumbled, ìIím getting up.î

He sat up and Hagridís heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.

Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didnít wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagridís coat.

ìDonít do that.î

Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.

ìHagrid!î said Harry loudly. ìThereís an owlóî

ìPay him,î Hagrid grunted into the sofa.

ìWhat?î

ìHe wants payiní fer deliveriní the paper. Look in the pockets.î

Hagridís coat seemed to be made of nothing but pocketsóbunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabagsÖ finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.

ìGive him five Knuts,î said Hagrid sleepily.

ìKnuts?î

ìThe little bronze ones.î

Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.

Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.

ìBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London aní buy all yer stuff fer school.î

Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.

ìUmóHagrid?î

ìMm?î said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.

ìI havenít got any moneyóand you heard Uncle Vernon last nightÖ he wonít pay for me to go and learn magic.î

ìDonít worry about that,î said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. ìDíyeh think yer parents didnít leave yeh anything?î

ìBut if their house was destroyedóî

ìThey didní keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizardsí bank. Have a sausage, theyíre not bad coldóaní I wouldní say no teh a bit oí yer birthday cake, neither.î

ìWizards have banks?î

ìJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.î

Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.

ìGoblins?î

ìYeahóso yehíd be mad ter try aní rob it, Iíll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safeóícept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter oí fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.î Hagrid drew himself up proudly. ìHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchiní you gettiní things from Gringottsóknows he can trust me, see.

ìGot everythiní? Come on, then.î

Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.

ìHow did you get here?î Harry asked, looking around for another boat.

ìFlew,î said Hagrid.

ìFlew?î

ìYeahóbut weíll go back in this. Not sípposed ter use magic now Iíve got yeh.î

They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.

ìSeems a shame ter row, though,î said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. ìIf I was teróeróspeed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentioniní it at Hogwarts?î

ìOf course not,î said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.

ìWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?î Harry asked.

ìSpellsóenchantments,î said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. ìThey say thereís dragons guardiní the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer wayóGringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yehíd die of hunger tryiní ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.î

Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, heíd never had so many questions in his life.

ìMinistry oí Magic messiní things up as usual,î Hagrid muttered, turning the page.

ìThereís a Ministry of Magic?î Harry asked, before he could stop himself.

ìíCourse,î said Hagrid. ìThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, oí course, but heíd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askiní fer advice.î

ìBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?î

ìWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that thereís still witches aní wizards up aní down the country.î

ìWhy?î

ìWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyoneíd be wantiní magic solutions to their problems. Nah, weíre best left alone.î

At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.

Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldnít blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, ìSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?î

ìHagrid,î said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, ìdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?î

ìWell, so they say,î said Hagrid. ìCrikey, Iíd like a dragon.î

ìYouíd like one?î

ìWanted one ever since I was a kidóhere we go.î

They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutesí time. Hagrid, who didnít understand ìMuggle money,î as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.

People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.

ìStill got yer letter, Harry?î he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.

ìGood,î said Hagrid. ìThereís a list there of everything yeh need.î

Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnít noticed the night before, and read:

ìCan we buy all this in London?î Harry wondered aloud.

ìIf yeh know where to go,î said Hagrid.

Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.

ìI donít know how the Muggles manage without magic,î he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.

Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadnít known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldnít help trusting him.

ìThis is it,î said Hagrid, coming to a halt, ìthe Leaky Cauldron. Itís a famous place.î

It was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadnít pointed it out, Harry wouldnít have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didnít glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnít see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.

For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, ìThe usual, Hagrid?î

ìCanít, Tom, Iím on Hogwarts business,î said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harryís shoulder and making Harryís knees buckle.

ìGood Lord,î said the bartender, peering at Harry, ìis thisócan this be ?î

The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.

ìBless my soul,î whispered the old bartender, ìHarry PotterÖ what an honor.î

He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.

ìWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.î

Harry didnít know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.

Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.

ìDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, canít believe Iím meeting you at last.î

ìSo proud, Mr. Potter, Iím just so proud.î

ìAlways wanted to shake your handóIím all of a flutter.î

ìDelighted, Mr. Potter, just canít tell you, Diggleís the name, Dedalus Diggle.î

ìIíve seen you before!î said Harry, as Dedalus Diggleís top hat fell off in his excitement. ìYou bowed to me once in a shop.î

ìHe remembers!î cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. ìDid you hear that? He remembers me!î Harry shook hands again and againóDoris Crockford kept coming back for more.

A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.

ìProfessor Quirrell!î said Hagrid. ìHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.î

ìP-P-Potter,î stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harryís hand, ìc-canít t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.î

ìWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?î

ìD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,î muttered Professor Quirrell, as though heíd rather not think about it. ìN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?î He laughed nervously. ìYouíll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? Iíve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.î He looked terrified at the very thought.

But the others wouldnít let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.

ìMust get onólots ter buy. Come on, Harry.î

Doris Crockford shook Harryís hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.

Hagrid grinned at Harry.

ìTold yeh, didnít I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was trembliní ter meet yehómind you, heís usually trembliní.î

ìIs he always that nervous?î

ìOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyiní outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experienceÖ They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit oí trouble with a hagónever been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, whereís me umbrella?î

Vampires? Hags? Harryís head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.

ìThree upÖ two across,î he muttered. ìRight, stand back, Harry.î

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.

The brick he had touched quiveredóit wriggledóin the middle, a small hole appearedóit grew wider and wideróa second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.

ìWelcome,î said Hagrid, ìto Diagon Alley.î

He grinned at Harryís amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.

The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. CauldronsóAll SizesóCopper, Brass, Pewter, SilveróSelf StirringóCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them.

ìYeah, youíll be neediní one,î said Hagrid, ìbut we gotta get yer money first.î

Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, ìDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, theyíre madÖî

A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl EmporiumóTawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harryís age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. ìLook,î Harry heard one of them say, ìthe new Nimbus Two Thousandófastest everóî There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eelsí eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moonÖ

ìGringotts,î said Hagrid.

They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, wasó

ìYeah, thatís a goblin,î said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:

		Enter, stranger, but take heed
		Of what awaits the sin of greed,
		For those who take, but do not earn,
		Must pay most dearly in their turn.

		So if you seek beneath our floors
		A treasure that was never yours,
		Thief, you have been warned, beware
		Of finding more than treasure there.

ìLike I said, Yehíd be mad ter try aní rob it,î said Hagrid.

A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.

ìMorning,î said Hagrid to a free goblin. ìWeíve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potterís safe.î

ìYou have his key, sir?î

ìGot it here somewhere,î said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblinís book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.

ìGot it,î said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.

The goblin looked at it closely.

ìThat seems to be in order.î

ìAní Iíve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,î said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. ìItís about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.î

The goblin read the letter carefully.

ìVery well,î he said, handing it back to Hagrid, ìI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!î

Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.

ìWhatís the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?î Harry asked.

ìCanít tell yeh that,î said Hagrid mysteriously. ìVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledoreís trusted me. More ín my jobís worth ter tell yeh that.î

Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed inóHagrid with some difficultyóand were off.

At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasnít steering.

Harryís eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too lateóthey plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.

ìI never know,î Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, ìwhatís the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?î

ìStalagmiteís got an ëmí in it,î said Hagrid. ìAní doní ask me questions just now, I think Iím gonna be sick.î

He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.

Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

ìAll yours,î smiled Hagrid.

All Harryísóit was incredible. The Dursleys couldnít have known about this or theyíd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.

ìThe gold ones are Galleons,î he explained. ìSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle, itís easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple oí terms, weíll keep the rest safe for yeh.î He turned to Griphook. ìVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?î

ìOne speed only,î said Griphook.

They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.

Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.

ìStand back,î said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.

ìIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, theyíd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,î said Griphook.

ìHow often do you check to see if anyoneís inside?î Harry asked.

ìAbout once every ten years,î said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very leastóbut at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.

ìCome on, back in this infernal cart, and donít talk to me on the way back, itís best if I keep me mouth shut,î said Hagrid.

One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didnít know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didnít have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than heíd had in his whole lifeómore money than even Dudley had ever had.

ìMight as well get yer uniform,î said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkinís Robes for All Occasions. ìListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.î He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkinís shop alone, feeling nervous.

Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.

ìHogwarts, dear?î she said, when Harry started to speak. ìGot the lot hereóanother young man being fitted up just now, in fact.î

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.

ìHello,î said the boy, ìHogwarts, too?î

ìYes,î said Harry.

ìMy fatherís next door buying my books and motherís up the street looking at wands,î said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. ìThen Iím going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I donít see why first years canít have their own. I think Iíll bully father into getting me one and Iíll smuggle it in somehow.î

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.

ìHave you got your own broom?î the boy went on.

ìNo,î said Harry.

ìPlay Quidditch at all?î

ìNo,î Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.

ìI doóFather says itís a crime if Iím not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house youíll be in yet?î

ìNo,î said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

ìWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know Iíll be in Slytherin, all our family have beenóimagine being in Hufflepuff, I think Iíd leave, wouldnít you?î

ìMmm,î said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.

ìI say, look at that man!î said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnít come in.

ìThatís Hagrid,î said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didnít. ìHe works at Hogwarts.î

ìOh,î said the boy, ìIíve heard of him. Heís a sort of servant, isnít he?î

ìHeís the gamekeeper,î said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.

ìYes, exactly. I heard heís a sort of savageólives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.î

ìI think heís brilliant,î said Harry coldly.

ìDo you?î said the boy, with a slight sneer. ìWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?î

ìTheyíre dead,î said Harry shortly. He didnít feel much like going into the matter with this boy.

ìOh, sorry,î said the other, not sounding sorry at all. ìBut they were our kind, werenít they?î

ìThey were a witch and wizard, if thatís what you mean.î

ìI really donít think they should let the other sort in, do you? Theyíre just not the same, theyíve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. Whatís your surname, anyway?î

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, ìThatís you done, my dear,î and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.

ìWell, Iíll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,î said the drawling boy.

Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).

ìWhatís up?î said Hagrid.

ìNothing,î Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, ìHagrid, whatís Quidditch?î

ìBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettiní how little yeh knowónot knowiní about Quidditch!î

ìDonít make me feel worse,î said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkinís.

ìóand he said people from Muggle families shouldnít even be allowed in.î

ìYer not from a Muggle family. If heíd known who yeh wereóheís grown up knowiní yer name if his parents are wizardiní folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some oí the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in íem in a long line oí Mugglesólook at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!î

ìSo what is Quidditch?î

ìItís our sport. Wizard sport. Itís likeólike soccer in the Muggle worldóeveryone follows Quidditchóplayed up in the air on broomsticks and thereís four ballsósorta hard ter explain the rules.î

ìAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?î

ìSchool houses. Thereís four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot oí duffers, butóî

ìI bet Iím in Hufflepuff,î said Harry gloomily.

ìBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,î said Hagrid darkly. ìThereís not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnít in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.î

ìVolósorryóYou-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?î

ìYears aní years ago,î said Hagrid.

They bought Harryís school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.

ìI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.î

ìIím not sayiní thatís not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,î said Hagrid. ìAní anyway, yeh couldní work any of the curses yet, yehíll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.î

Hagrid wouldnít let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (ìIt says pewter on yer listî), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harryís list again.

ìJust yer wand leftóA yeah, aní I still havenít got yeh a birthday present.î

Harry felt himself go red.

ìYou donít have toóî

ìI know I donít have to. Tell yeh what, Iíll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yehíd be laughed atóaní I doní like cats, they make me sneeze. Iíll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, theyíre dead useful, carry yer mail aní everythiní.î

Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldnít stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.

ìDoní mention it,î said Hagrid gruffly. ìDoní expect youíve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanderís left nowóonly place fer wands, Ollivanderís, and yeh gotta have the best wand.î

A magic wandÖ this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.

The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.

A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.

ìGood afternoon,î said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.

An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.

ìHello,î said Harry awkwardly.

ìAh yes,î said the man. ìYes, yes. I thought Iíd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.î It wasnít a question. ìYou have your motherís eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.î

Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.

ìYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored itóitís really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.î

Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.

ìAnd thatís whereÖî

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harryís forehead with a long, white finger.

ìIím sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,î he said softly. ìThirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong handsÖ well, if Iíd known what that wand was going out into the world to doÖî

He shook his head and then, to Harryís relief, spotted Hagrid.

ìRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you againÖ Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasnít it?î

ìIt was, sir, yes,î said Hagrid.

ìGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?î said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.

ìEróyes, they did, yes,î said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. ìIíve still got the pieces, though,î he added brightly.

ìBut you donít use them?î said Mr. Ollivander sharply.

ìOh, no, sir,î said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.

ìHmmm,î said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. ìWell, nowóMr. Potter. Let me see.î He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. ìWhich is your wand arm?î

ìErówell, Iím right handed,î said Harry.

ìHold out your arm. Thatís it.î He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, ìEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizardís wand.î

Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.

ìThat will do,î he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. ìRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.î

Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.

ìMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Tryóî

Harry triedóbut he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.

ìNo, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.î

Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.

ìTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, weíll find the perfect match here somewhereóI wonder, nowóyes, why notóunusual combinationóholly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.î

Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, ìOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, wellÖ how curiousÖ how very curiousÖî

He put Harryís wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, ìCuriousÖ curiousÖî

ìSorry,î said Harry, ìbutwhatís curious?î

Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.

ìI remember every wand Iíve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another featherójust one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when itís brotherówhy, itís brother gave you that scar.î

Harry swallowed.

ìYes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, rememberÖ I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. PotterÖ After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great thingsóterrible, yes, but great.î

Harry shivered. He wasnít sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.

The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didnít speak at all as they walked down the road; he didnít even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harryís lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.

ìGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,î he said.

He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.

ìYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,î said Hagrid.

Harry wasnít sure he could explain. Heíd just had the best birthday of his lifeóand yetóhe chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.

ìEveryone thinks Iím special,î he said at last. ìAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. OllivanderÖ but I donít know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? Iím famous and I canít even remember what Iím famous for. I donít know what happened when VolósorryóI mean, the night my parents died.î

Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.

ìDoní you worry, Harry. Youíll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, youíll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know itís hard. Yehíve been singled out, aní thatís always hard. But yehíll have a great time at HogwartsóI didóstill do, ísmatter of fact.î

Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.

ìYer ticket fer Hogwarts,î he said. ìFirst oí SeptemberóKingís Crossóitís all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, sheíll know where to find meÖ See yeh soon, Harry.î

The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.




6. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS


Harryís last month with the Dursleys wasnít fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldnít stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didnít shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at himóin fact, they didnít speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.

Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didnít come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.

On the last day of August he thought heíd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to Kingís Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.

ìEróUncle Vernon?î

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.

ìEróI need to be at Kingís Cross tomorrow toóto go to Hogwarts.î

Uncle Vernon grunted again.

ìWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?î

Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.

ìThank you.î

He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.

ìFunny way to get to a wizardsí school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?î

Harry didnít say anything.

ìWhere is this school, anyway?î

ìI donít know,î said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.

ìI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven oíclock,î he read.

His aunt and uncle stared.

ìPlatform what?î

ìNine and three-quarters.î

ìDonít talk rubbish,î said Uncle Vernon. ìThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.î

ìItís on my ticket.î

ìBarking,î said Uncle Vernon, ìhowling mad, the lot of them. Youíll see. You just wait. All right, weíll take you to Kingís Cross. Weíre going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldnít bother.î

ìWhy are you going to London?î Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.

ìTaking Dudley to the hospital,î growled Uncle Vernon. ìGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.î

Harry woke at five oíclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnít want to walk into the station in his wizardís robesóheíd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harryís huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleysí car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.

They reached Kingís Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harryís trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.

ìWell, there you are, boy. Platform nineóplatform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they donít seem to have built it yet, do they?î

He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.

ìHave a good term,î said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harryís mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. Heíd have to ask someone.

He stopped a passing guard, but didnít dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldnít even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven oíclock, but the guard said there wasnít one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.

Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectorís stand between platforms nine and ten.

At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.

ìópacked with Muggles, of courseóî

Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harryís in front of himóand they had an owl.

Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.

ìNow, whatís the platform number?î said the boysí mother.

ìNine and three-quarters!î piped a small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, ìMom, canít I goÖî

ìYouíre not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.î

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed itóbut just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.

ìFred, you next,î the plump woman said.

ìIím not Fred, Iím George,î said the boy. ìHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Canít you tell Iím George?î

ìSorry, George, dear.î

ìOnly joking, I am Fred,î said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had goneóbut how had he done it?

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost thereóand then, quite suddenly, he wasnít anywhere.

There was nothing else for it.

ìExcuse me,î Harry said to the plump woman.

ìHello, dear,î she said. ìFirst time at Hogwarts? Ronís new, too.î

She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.

ìYes,î said Harry. ìThe thing isóthe thing is, I donít know how toóî

ìHow to get onto the platform?î she said kindly, and Harry nodded.

ìNot to worry,î she said. ìAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Donít stop and donít be scared youíll crash into it, thatís very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if youíre nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.î

ìEróokay,î said Harry.

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.

He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then heíd be in troubleóleaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy runóthe barrier was coming nearer and neareróhe wouldnít be able to stopóthe cart was out of controlóhe was a foot awayóhe closed his eyes ready for the crashó

It didnít comeÖ he kept on runningÖ he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven oíclock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-quarters on it, He had done it.

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.

The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round faced boy who was saying, ìGran, Iíve lost my toad again.î

ìOh, Neville,î he heard the old woman sigh.

A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.

ìGive us a look, Lee, go on.î

The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.

Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.

ìWant a hand?î It was one of the red haired twins heíd followed through the barrier.

ìYes, please,î Harry panted.

ìOy, Fred! Címere and help!î

With the twinsí help, Harryís trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.

ìThanks,î said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.

ìWhatís that?î said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harryís lightning scar.

ìBlimey,î said the other twin. ìAre youóî

ìHe is,î said the first twin. ìArenít you?î he added to Harry.

ìWhat?î said Harry.

ìHarry Potter,î chorused the twins.

ìOh, him,î said Harry. ìI mean, yes, I am.î

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the trainís open door.

ìFred? George? Are you there?î

ìComing, Mom.î

With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.

Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.

ìRon, youíve got something on your nose.î

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.

ìMomógeroffóî He wriggled free.

ìAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?î said one of the twins.

ìShut up,î said Ron.

ìWhereís Percy?î said their mother.

ìHeís coming now.î

The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.

ìCanít stay long, Mother,î he said. ìIím up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselvesóî

ìOh, are you a prefect, Percy?î said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. ìYou should have said something, we had no idea.î

ìHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,î said the other twin. ìOnceóî

ìOr twiceóî

ìA minuteóî

ìAll summeróî

ìOh, shut up,î said Percy the Prefect.

ìHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?î said one of the twins.

ìBecause heís a prefect,î said their mother fondly. ìAll right, dear, well, have a good termósend me an owl when you get there.î

She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.

ìNow, you twoóthis year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me youíveóyouíve blown up a toilet oróî

ìBlown up a toilet? Weíve never blown up a toilet.î

ìGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.î

ìItís not funny. And look after Ron.î

ìDonít worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.î

ìShut up,î said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.

ìHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?î

Harry leaned back quickly so they couldnít see him looking.

ìYou know that black haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?î

ìWho?î

ìHarry Potter!î

Harry heard the little girlís voice.

ìOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh pleaseÖî

ìYouíve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isnít something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?î

ìAsked him. Saw his scar. Itís really thereólike lightning.î

ìPoor dearóno wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.î

ìNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?î

Their mother suddenly became very stern.

ìI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, donít you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.î

ìAll right, keep your hair on.î

A whistle sounded.

ìHurry up!î their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began to cry.

ìDonít, Ginny, weíll send you loads of owls.î

ìWeíll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.î

ìGeorge!î

ìOnly joking, Mom.î

The train began to move. Harry saw the boysí mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.

Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didnít know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.

The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.

ìAnyone sitting there?î he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. ìEverywhere else is full.î

Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadnít looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.

ìHey, Ron.î

The twins were back.

ìListen, weíre going down the middle of the trainóLee Jordanís got a giant tarantula down there.î

ìRight,î mumbled Ron.

ìHarry,î said the other twin, ìdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.î

ìBye,î said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.

ìAre you really Harry Potter?î Ron blurted out.

Harry nodded.

ìOh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Georgeís jokes,î said Ron. ìAnd have you really gotóyou knowÖî

He pointed at Harryís forehead.

Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.

ìSo thatís where You-Know-Whoó?î

ìYes,î said Harry, ìbut I canít remember it.î

ìNothing?î said Ron eagerly.

ìWellóI remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.î

ìWow,î said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.

ìAre all your family wizards?î asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.

ìEróYes, I think so,î said Ron. ìI think Momís got a second cousin whoís an accountant, but we never talk about him.î

ìSo you must know loads of magic already.î

The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.

ìI heard you went to live with Muggles,î said Ron. ìWhat are they like?î

ìHorribleówell, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish Iíd had three wizard brothers.î

ìFive,î said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. ìIím the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say Iíve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already leftóBill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percyís a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyíre really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, itís no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. Iíve got Billís old robes, Charlieís old wand, and Percyís old rat.î

Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.

ìHis nameís Scabbers and heís useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldnít affóI mean, I got Scabbers instead.î

Ronís ears went pink. He seemed to think heíd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.

Harry didnít think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, heíd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudleyís old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.

ìÖand until Hagrid told me, I didnít know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemortóî

Ron gasped.

ìWhat?î said Harry.

ìYou said You-Know-Whoís name!î said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. ìIíd have thought you, of all peopleóî

ìIím not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,î said Harry, ìI just never knew you shouldnít. See what I mean? Iíve got loads to learnÖ I bet,î he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, ìI bet Iím the worst in the class.î

ìYou wonít be. Thereís loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.î

While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, ìAnything off the cart, dears?î

Harry, who hadnít had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ronís ears went pink again and he muttered that heíd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.

He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carryóbut the woman didnít have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bottís Every Flavor Beans, Droobleís Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.

Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.

ìHungry, are you?î

ìStarving,î said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.

Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, ìShe always forgets I donít like corned beef.î

ìSwap you for one of these,î said Harry, holding up a pasty. ìGo onóî

ìYou donít want this, itís all dry,î said Ron. ìShe hasnít got much time,î he added quickly, ìyou know, with five of us.î

ìGo on, have a pasty,î said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harryís pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).

ìWhat are these?î Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. ìTheyíre not really frogs, are they?î He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.

ìNo,î said Ron. ìBut see what the card is. Iím missing Agrippa.î

ìWhat?î

ìOh, of course, you wouldnít knowóChocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collectófamous witches and wizards. Iíve got about five hundred, but I havenít got Agrippa or Ptolemy.î

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a manís face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.

ìSo this is Dumbledore!î said Harry.

ìDonít tell me youíd never heard of Dumbledore!î said Ron. ìCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippaóthanksóî

Harry turned over his card and read:



ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragonís blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.


Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledoreís face had disappeared.

ìHeís gone!î

ìWell, you canít expect him to hang around all day,î said Ron. ìHeíll be back. No, Iíve got Morgana again and Iíve got about six of herÖ do you want it? You can start collecting.î

Ronís eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.

ìHelp yourself,î said Harry. ìBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.î

ìDo they? What, they donít move at all?î Ron sounded amazed. ìWeird!î

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldnít keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bottís Every Flavor Beans.

ìYou want to be careful with those,î Ron warned Harry. ìWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavoróyou know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.î

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.

ìBleaaarghósee? Sprouts.î

They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldnít touch, which turned out to be pepper.

The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.

There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.

ìSorry,î he said, ìbut have you seen a toad at all?î

When they shook their heads, he wailed, ìIíve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!î

ìHeíll turn up,î said Harry.

ìYes,î said the boy miserably. ìWell, if you see himÖî

He left.

ìDonít know why heís so bothered,î said Ron. ìIf Iíd brought a toad Iíd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I canít talk.î

The rat was still snoozing on Ronís lap.

ìHe might have died and you wouldnít know the difference,î said Ron in disgust. ìI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didnít work. Iíll show you, lookÖî

He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.

ìUnicorn hairís nearly poking out. Anywayóî

He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.

ìHas anyone seen a toad? Nevilleís lost one,î she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.

ìWeíve already told him we havenít seen it,î said Ron, but the girl wasnít listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.

ìOh, are you doing magic? Letís see it, then.î

She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.

ìEróall right.î

He cleared his throat.

		ìSunshine, daisies, butter mellow,
		Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.î

He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.

ìAre you sure thatís a real spell?î said the girl. ìWell, itís not very good, is it? Iíve tried a few simple spells just for practice and itís all worked for me. Nobody in my familyís magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, itís the very best school of witchcraft there is, Iíve heardóIíve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enoughóIím Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?î

She said all this very fast.

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnít learned all the course books by heart either.

ìIím Ron Weasley,î Ron muttered.

ìHarry Potter,î said Harry.

ìAre you really?î said Hermione. ìI know all about you, of courseóI got a few extra books for background reading, and youíre in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.î

ìAm I?î said Harry, feeling dazed.

ìGoodness, didnít you know, Iíd have found out everything I could if it was me,î said Hermione. ìDo either of you know what house youíll be in? Iíve been asking around, and I hope Iím in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldnít be too badÖ Anyway, weíd better go and look for Nevilleís toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect weíll be there soon.î

And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

ìWhatever house Iím in, I hope sheís not in it,î said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. ìStupid spellóGeorge gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.î

ìWhat house are your brothers in?î asked Harry.

ìGryffindor,î said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. ìMom and Dad were in it, too. I donít know what theyíll say if Iím not. I donít suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.î

ìThatís the house Voló, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?î

ìYeah,î said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

ìYou know, I think the ends of Scabbersí whiskers are a bit lighter,î said Harry, trying to take Ronís mind off houses. ìSo what do your oldest brothers do now that theyíve left, anyway?î

Harry was wondering what a wizard did once heíd finished school.

ìCharlieís in Romania studying dragons, and Billís in Africa doing something for Gringotts,î said Ron. ìDid you hear about Gringotts? Itís been all over the Daily Prophet, but I donít suppose you get that with the Mugglesósomeone tried to rob a high security vault.î

Harry stared.

ìReally? What happened to them?î

ìNothing, thatís why itís such big news. They havenít been caught. My dad says it mustíve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they donít think they took anything, thatís whatís odd. íCourse, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Whoís behind it.î

Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying ìVoldemortî without worrying.

ìWhatís your favorite Quidditch team?î Ron asked.

ìEróI donít know any,î Harry confessed.

ìWhat!î Ron looked dumbfounded. ìOh, you wait, itís the best game in the worldóî And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games heíd been to with his brothers and the broomstick heíd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasnít Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.

Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkinís robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than heíd shown back in Diagon Alley.

ìIs it true?î he said. ìTheyíre saying all down the train that Harry Potterís in this compartment. So itís you, is it?î

ìYes,î said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.

ìOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,î said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. ìAnd my nameís Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.î

Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.

ìThink my nameís funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.î

He turned back to Harry. ìYouíll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You donít want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.î

He held out his hand to shake Harryís, but Harry didnít take it.

ìI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,î he said coolly.

Draco Malfoy didnít go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.

ìIíd be careful if I were you, Potter,î he said slowly. ìUnless youíre a bit politer youíll go the same way as your parents. They didnít know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and itíll rub off on you.î

Both Harry and Ron stood up.

ìSay that again,î Ron said, his face as red as his hair.

ìOh, youíre going to fight us, are you?î Malfoy sneered.

ìUnless you get out now,î said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.

ìBut we donít feet like leaving, do we, boys? Weíve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.î

Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to RonóRon leapt forward, but before heíd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.

Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyleís knuckleóCrabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps theyíd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.

ìWhat has been going on?î she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.

ìI think heís been knocked out,î Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. ìNoóI donít believe itóheís gone back to sleepóî

And so he had.

ìYouíve met Malfoy before?î

Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.

ìIíve heard of his family,î said Ron darkly. ìThey were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said theyíd been bewitched. My dad doesnít believe it. He says Malfoyís father didnít need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.î He turned to Hermione. ìCan we help you with something?î

ìYouíd better hurry up and put your robes on, Iíve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says weíre nearly there. You havenít been fighting, have you? Youíll be in trouble before we even get there!î

ìScabbers has been fighting, not us,î said Ron, scowling at her. ìWould you mind leaving while we change?î

ìAll rightóI only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,î said Hermione in a sniffy voice. ìAnd youíve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?î

Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.

He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ronís were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.

A voice echoed through the train: ìWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutesí time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.î

Harryís stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: ìFirsí years! Firsí years over here! All right there, Harry?î

Hagridís big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

ìCímon, follow meóany more firsí years? Mind yer step, now! Firsí years follow me!î

Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.

ìYeí all get yer firsí sight oí Hogwarts in a sec,î Hagrid called over his shoulder, ìjusí round this bend here.î

There was a loud ìOooooh!î

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

ìNo moreín four to a boat!î Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.

ìEveryone in?î shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. ìRight thenóFORWARD!î

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.

ìHeads down!î yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.

ìOy, you there! Is this your toad?î said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.

ìTrevor!î cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagridís lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.

ìEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?î

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.




7. THE SORTING HAT


The door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harryís first thought was that this was not someone to cross.

ìThe firsí years, Professor McGonagall,î said Hagrid.

ìThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.î

She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleysí house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.

They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be hereóbut Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.

ìWelcome to Hogwarts,î said Professor McGonagall. ìThe start of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.

ìThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.

ìThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.î

Her eyes lingered for a moment on Nevilleís cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ronís smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.

ìI shall return when we are ready for you,î said Professor McGonagall. ìPlease wait quietly.î

She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.

ìHow exactly do they sort us into houses?î he asked Ron.

ìSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.î

Harryís heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didnít know any magic yetówhat on earth would he have to do? He hadnít expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells sheíd learned and wondering which one sheíd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. Heíd never been more nervous, never, not even when heíd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that heíd somehow turned his teacherís wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.

Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the airóseveral people behind him screamed.

ìWhat theó?î

He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: ìForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chanceóî

ìMy dear Friar, havenít we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, heís not really even a ghostóI say, what are you all doing here?î

A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.

Nobody answered.

ìNew students!î said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. ìAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?î

A few people nodded mutely.

ìHope to see you in Hufflepuff!î said the Friar. ìMy old house, you know.î

ìMove along now,î said a sharp voice. ìThe Sorting Ceremonyís about to start.î

Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.

ìNow, form a line,î Professor McGonagall told the first years, ìand follow me.î

Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, ìItís bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.î

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didnít simply open on to the heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizardís hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldnít have let it in the house.

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thingónoticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouthóand the hat began to sing:

		ìOh, you may not think Iím pretty,
		But donít judge on what you see,
		Iíll eat myself if you can find
		A smarter hat than me.

		You can keep your bowlers black,
		Your top hats sleek and tall,
		For Iím the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
		And I can cap them all.

		Thereís nothing hidden in your head
		The Sorting Hat canít see,
		So try me on and I will tell you
		Where you ought to be.

		You might belong in Gryffindor,
		Where dwell the brave at heart,
		Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
		Set Gryffindors apart;

		You might belong in Hufflepuff,
		Where they are just and loyal,
		Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
		And unafraid of toil;

		Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
		If youíve a ready mind,
		Where those of wit and learning,
		Will always find their kind;

		Or perhaps in Slytherin
		Youíll make your real friends,
		Those cunning folk use any means
		To achieve their ends.

		So put me on! Donít be afraid!
		And donít get in a flap!
		Youíre in safe hands (though I have none)
		For Iím a Thinking Cap!î

The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.

ìSo weíve just got to try on the hat!î Ron whispered to Harry. ìIíll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.î

Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didnít feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.

ìWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,î she said. ìAbbott, Hannah!î

A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pauseó

ìHUFFLEPUFF!î shouted the hat.

The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.

ìBones, Susan!î

ìHUFFLEPUFF!î shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.

ìBoot, Terry!î

ìRAVENCLAW!î

The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.

ìBrocklehurst, Mandyî went to Ravenclaw too, but ìBrown, Lavenderî became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ronís twin brothers catcalling.

ìBulstrode, Millicentî then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harryís imagination, after all heíd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

ìFinch-Fletchley, Justin!î

ìHUFFLEPUFF!î

Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. ìFinnigan, Seamus,î the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.

ìGranger, Hermione!î

Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.

ìGRYFFINDOR!î shouted the hat. Ron groaned.

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when youíre very nervous. What if he wasnít chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and heíd better get back on the train?

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, ìGRYFFINDOR,î Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to ìMacDougal, Morag.î

Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, ìSLYTHERIN!î

Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.

There werenít many people left now. ìMoonîÖ, ìNottîÖ, ìParkinsonîÖ, then a pair of twin girls, ìPatilî and ìPatilîÖ, then ìPerks, Sally AnneîÖ, and then, at lastó

ìPotter, Harry!î

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

ìPotter, did she say?î

ìThe Harry Potter?î

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.

ìHmm,î said a small voice in his ear. ìDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. Thereís talent,†ah my goodness, yesóand a nice thirst to prove yourself, now thatís interestingÖ So where shall I put you?î

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.

ìNot Slytherin, eh?î said the small voice. ìAre you sure? You could be great, you know, itís all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about thatóno? Well, if youíre sureóbetter be GRYFFINDOR!î

Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, ìWe got Potter! We got Potter!î Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff heíd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling heíd just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water.

He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card heíd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledoreís silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.

And now there were only three people left to be sorted. ìThomas, Dean,î a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. ìTurpin, Lisa,î became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ronís turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, ìGRYFFINDOR!î

Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.

ìWell done, Ron, excellent,î said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as ìZabini, Blaise,î was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.

Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.

Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.

ìWelcome,î he said. ìWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

ìThank you!î

He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didnít know whether to laugh or not.

ìIs heóa bit mad?î he asked Percy uncertainly.

ìMad?î said Percy airily. ìHeís a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?î

Harryís mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.

The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but heíd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.

ìThat does look good,î said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, ìCanít youó?î

ìI havenít eaten for nearly four hundred years,î said the ghost. ìI donít need to, of course, but one does miss it. I donít think Iíve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.î

ìI know who you are!î said Ron suddenly. ìMy brothers told me about youóyouíre Nearly Headless Nick!î

ìI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsyóî the ghost began stiffly, but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.

ìNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?î

Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasnít going at all the way he wanted.

ìLike this,î he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, ìSoónew Gryffindors! I hope youíre going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baronís becoming almost unbearableóheís the Slytherin ghost.î

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didnít look too pleased with the seating arrangements.

ìHow did he get covered in blood?î asked Seamus with great interest.

ìIíve never asked,î said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.

When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice puddingóî

As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.

ìIím half-and-half,î said Seamus. ìMe dadís a Muggle. Mom didnít tell him she was a witch ítil after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.î

The others laughed.

ìWhat about you, Neville?î said Ron.

ìWell, my gran brought me up and sheís a witch,î said Neville, ìbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of meóhe pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drownedóbut nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bouncedóall the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in hereóthey thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.î

On Harryís other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (ìI do hope they start right away, thereís so much to learn, Iím particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, itís supposed to be very difficultî; ìYouíll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thingóî).

Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.

It happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrellís turban straight into Harryís eyesóand a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harryís forehead.

ìOuch!î Harry clapped a hand to his head.

ìWhat is it?î asked Percy.

ìN-nothing.î

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacherís lookóa feeling that he didnít like Harry at all.

ìWhoís that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?î he asked Percy.

ìOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder heís looking so nervous, thatís Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesnít want toóeveryone knows heís after Quirrellís job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.î

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didnít look at him again.

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.

ìAhemójust a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start of term notices to give you.

ìFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.î

Dumbledoreís twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.

ìI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

ìQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.

ìAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.î

Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

ìHeís not serious?î he muttered to Percy.

ìMust be,î said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. ìItís odd, because he usually gives us a reason why weíre not allowed to go somewhereóthe forestís full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.î

ìAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!î cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachersí smiles had become rather fixed.

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.

ìEveryone pick their favorite tune,î said Dumbledore, ìand off we go!î

And the school bellowed:

		Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
		Teach us something please,
		Whether we be old and bald
		Or young with scabby knees,

		Our heads could do with filling
		With some interesting stuff,
		For now theyíre bare and full of air,
		Dead flies and bits of fluff,

		So teach us things worth knowing,
		Bring back what weíve forgot,
		Just do your best, weíll do the rest,
		And learn until our brains all rot.

Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.

ìAh, music,î he said, wiping his eyes. ìA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!î

The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harryís legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.

ìPeeves,î Percy whispered to the first years. ìA poltergeist.î He raised his voice, ìPeevesóshow yourself!î

A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.

ìDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?î

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.

ìOooooooh!î he said, with an evil cackle. ìIckle Firsties! What fun!î

He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.

ìGo away, Peeves, or the Baroníll hear about this, I mean it!î barked Percy.

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Nevilleís head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.

ìYou want to watch out for Peeves,î said Percy, as they set off again. ìThe Bloody Baronís the only one who can control him, he wonít even listen to us prefects. Here we are.î

At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.

ìPassword?î she said.

ìCaput Draconis,î said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through itóNeville needed a leg upóand found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.

Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircaseóthey were obviously in one of the towersóthey found their beds at last: five four posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.

ìGreat food, isnít it?î Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. ìGet off, Scabbers! Heís chewing my sheets.î

Harry was going to ask Ron if heíd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrellís turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didnít want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfullyóand there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with itóthen Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and coldóthere was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.

He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didnít remember the dream at all.




8. THE POTIONS MASTER


ìThere, look.î

ìWhere?î

ìNext to the tall kid with the red hair.î

ìWearing the glasses?î

ìDid you see his face?î

ìDid you see his scar?î

Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldnít, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.

There were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldnít open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that werenít really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.

The ghosts didnít help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, ìGOT YOUR CONK!î

Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldnít believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filchís. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and sheíd whisk off for Filch, whoíd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.

And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.

They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harryís name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.

Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasnít a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class.

ìTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,î she said. ìAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.î

Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldnít wait to get started, but soon realized they werenít going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.

The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrellís lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire heíd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they werenít sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.

Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnít miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadnít had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didnít have much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.

ìWhat have we got today?î Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.

ìDouble Potions with the Slytherins,î said Ron. ìSnapeís Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors themóweíll be able to see if itís true.î

ìWish McGonagall favored us,î said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadnít stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.

Hedwig hadnít brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harryís plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:



Dear Harry,

I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?

I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.

Hagrid


Harry borrowed Ronís quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.

It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.

At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew heíd been wrong. Snape didnít dislike Harryóhe hated him.

Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harryís name.

ìAh, Yes,î he said softly, ìHarry Potter. Our newócelebrity.î

Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagridís, but they had none of Hagridís warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.

ìYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,î he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every wordólike Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. ìAs there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I donít expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the sensesÖ I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper deathóif you arenít as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.î

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnít a dunderhead.

ìPotter!î said Snape suddenly. ìWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?î

Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermioneís hand had shot into the air.

ìI donít know, sir,î said Harry.

Snapeís lips curled into a sneer.

ìTut, tutófame clearly isnít everything.î

He ignored Hermioneís hand.

ìLetís try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?î

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didnít have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.

ìI donít know, sir.î

ìThought you wouldnít open a book before coming, eh, Potter?î Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleysí, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?

Snape was still ignoring Hermioneís quivering hand.

ìWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?î

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.

ìI donít know,î said Harry quietly. ìI think Hermione does, though, why donít you try her?î

A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamusís eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.

ìSit down,î he snapped at Hermione. ìFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why arenít you all copying that down?î

There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, ìAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.î

Things didnít improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamusís cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in peopleís shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.

ìIdiot boy!î snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. ìI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?î

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.

ìTake him up to the hospital wing,î Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.

ìYouóPotterówhy didnít you tell him not to add the quills? Thought heíd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? Thatís another point youíve lost for Gryffindor.î

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.

ìDonít push it,î he muttered, ìIíve heard Snape can turn very nasty.î

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harryís mind was racing and his spirits were low. Heíd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first weekówhy did Snape hate him so much?

ìCheer up,î said Ron, ìSnapeís always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?î

At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.

When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagridís voice rang out, saying, ìBack, Fangóback.î

Hagridís big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.

ìHang on,î he said. ìBack, Fang.î

He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.

ìMake yerselves at home,î said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.

ìThis is Ron,î Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.

ìAnother Weasley, eh?î said Hagrid, glancing at Ronís freckles. ìI spent half me life chasiní yer twin brothers away from the forest.î

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harryís knee and drooled all over his robes.

Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch ìthat old git.î

ìAní as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, Iíd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. Díyeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Canít get rid of heróFitch puts her up to it.î

Harry told Hagrid about Snapeís lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.

ìBut he seemed to really hate me.î

ìRubbish!î said Hagrid. ìWhy should he?î

Yet Harry couldnít help thinking that Hagrid didnít quite meet his eyes when he said that.

ìHowís yer brother Charlie?î Hagrid asked Ron. ìI liked him a lotógreat with animals.î

Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlieís work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:



GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST

Investigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.

ìBut weíre not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know whatís good for you,î said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.


Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadnít mentioned the date.

ìHagrid!î said Harry, ìthat Gringotts break in happened on my birthday! It mightíve been happening while we were there!î

There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didnít meet Harryís eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?

As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyíd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons heíd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didnít want to tell Harry?




9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL


Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didnít have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didnít until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursdayóand Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.

ìTypical,î said Harry darkly. ìJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.î

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

ìYou donít know that youíll make a fool of yourself,î said Ron reasonably. ìAnyway, I know Malfoyís always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet thatís all talk.î

Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasnít the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, heíd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone whoíd listen about the time heíd almost hit a hang glider on Charlieís old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldnít see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Deanís poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt sheíd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.

Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldnít learn by heart out of a bookónot that she hadnít tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips sheíd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermioneís lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

Harry hadnít had a single letter since Hagridís note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoyís eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.

A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.

ìItís a Remembrall!î he explained. ìGran knows I forget thingsóthis tells you if thereís something youíve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns redóohÖî His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, ìÖyouíve forgotten somethingÖî

Neville was trying to remember what heíd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.

ìWhatís going on?î

ìMalfoyís got my Remembrall, Professor.î

Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.

ìJust looking,î he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.

At three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.

The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.

Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.

ìWell, what are you all waiting for?î she barked. ìEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.î

Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.

ìStick out your right hand over your broom,î called Madam Hooch at the front, ìand say ëUp!íî

ìUP!î everyone shouted.

Harryís broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Grangerís had simply rolled over on the ground, and Nevilleís hadnít moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Nevilleís voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy heíd been doing it wrong for years.

ìNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,î said Madam Hooch. ìKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistleóthreeótwoóî

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hoochís lips.

ìCome back, boy!î she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottleótwelve feetótwenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom andó

WHAMóa thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.

Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.

ìBroken wrist,î Harry heard her mutter. ìCome on, boyóitís all right, up you get.î

She turned to the rest of the class.

ìNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or youíll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ëQuidditch.í Come on, dear.î

Neville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.

No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.

ìDid you see his face, the great lump?î

The other Slytherins joined in.

ìShut up, Malfoy,î snapped Parvati Patil.

ìOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?î said Pansy Parkinson, a hard faced Slytherin girl. ìNever thought youíd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.î

ìLook!î said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. ìItís that stupid thing Longbottomís gran sent him.î

The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.

ìGive that here, Malfoy,î said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.

Malfoy smiled nastily.

ìI think Iíll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to findóhow aboutóup a tree?î

ìGive it here!î Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadnít been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, ìCome and get it, Potter!î

Harry grabbed his broom.

ìNo!î shouted Hermione Granger. ìMadam Hooch told us not to moveóyouíll get us all into trouble.î

Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized heíd found something he could do without being taughtóthis was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.

He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.

ìGive it here,î Harry called, ìor Iíll knock you off that broom!î

ìOh, yeah?î said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.

Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.

ìNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,î Harry called.

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.

ìCatch it if you can, then!î he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.

Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle downónext second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ballówind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watchingóhe stretched out his handóa foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.

ìHARRY POTTER!î

His heart sank faster than heíd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.

ìNeveróin all my time at Hogwartsóî

Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, ìóhow dare youómight have broken your neckóî

ìIt wasnít his fault, Professoróî

ìBe quiet, Miss Patil.î

ìBut Malfoyóî

ìThatís enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.î

Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyleís triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagallís wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now heíd done it. He hadnít even lasted two weeks. Heíd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?

Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didnít say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagridís assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagridís bag.

Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.

ìExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?î

Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?

But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused.

ìFollow me, you two,î said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.

ìIn here.î

Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.

ìOut, Peeves!î she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.

ìPotter, this is Oliver Wood. WoodóIíve found you a Seeker.î

Woodís expression changed from puzzlement to delight.

ìAre you serious, Professor?î

ìAbsolutely,î said Professor McGonagall crisply. ìThe boyís a natural. Iíve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?î

Harry nodded silently. He didnít have a clue what was going on, but he didnít seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.

ìHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive,î Professor McGonagall told Wood. ìDidnít even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldnít have done it.î

Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.

ìEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?î he asked excitedly.

ìWoodís captain of the Gryffindor team,î Professor McGonagall explained.

ìHeís just the build for a Seeker, too,î said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. ìLightóspeedyóweíll have to get him a decent broom, Professoróa Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, Iíd say.î

ìI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we canít bend the first year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldnít look Severus Snape in the face for weeksÖî

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.

ìI want to hear youíre training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.î

Then she suddenly smiled.

ìYour father would have been proud,î she said. ìHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.î

ìYouíre joking.î

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when heíd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but heíd forgotten all about it.

ìSeeker?î he said. ìBut first years neveróyou must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. ìWood told me.î

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.

ìI start training next week,î said Harry. ìOnly donít tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.î

Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.

ìWell done,î said George in a low voice. ìWood told us. Weíre on the team tooóBeaters.î

ìI tell you, weíre going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,î said Fred. ìWe havenít won since Charlie left, but this yearís team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.î

ìAnyway, weíve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons heís found a new secret passageway out of the school.î

ìBet itís that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.î

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

ìHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?î

ìYouíre a lot braver now that youíre back on the ground and youíve got your little friends with you,î said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.

ìIíd take you on anytime on my own,î said Malfoy. ìTonight, if you want. Wizardís duel. Wands onlyóno contact. Whatís the matter? Never heard of a wizardís duel before, I suppose?î

ìOf course he has,î said Ron, wheeling around. ìIím his second, whoís yours?î

Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.

ìCrabbe,î he said. ìMidnight all right? Weíll meet you in the trophy room; thatís always unlocked.î

When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. ìWhat is a wizardís duel?î said Harry. ìAnd what do you mean, youíre my second?î

ìWell, a secondís there to take over if you die,î said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harryís face, he added quickly, ìBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoyíll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.î

ìAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?î

ìThrow it away and punch him on the nose,î Ron suggested.

ìExcuse me.î

They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.

ìCanít a person eat in peace in this place?î said Ron.

Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.

ìI couldnít help overhearing what you and Malfoy were sayingóî

ìBet you could,î Ron muttered.

ìóand you mustnít go wandering around the school at night, think of the points youíll lose Gryffindor if youíre caught, and youíre bound to be. Itís really very selfish of you.î

ìAnd itís really none of your business,î said Harry.

ìGood-bye,î said Ron.

All the same, it wasnít what youíd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasnít back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as ìIf he tries to curse you, youíd better dodge it, because I canít remember how to block them.î There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoyís sneering face kept looming up out of the darknessóthis was his big chance to beat Malfoy face to face. He couldnít miss it.

ìHalf past eleven,î Ron muttered at last, ìweíd better go.î

They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, ìI canít believe youíre going to do this, Harry.î

A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.

ìYou!î said Ron furiously. ìGo back to bed!î

ìI almost told your brother,î Hermione snapped, ìPercyóheís a prefect, heíd put a stop to this.î

Harry couldnít believe anyone could be so interfering.

ìCome on,î he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.

Hermione wasnít going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.

ìDonít you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I donít want Slytherin to win the house cup, and youíll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.î

ìGo away.î

ìAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when youíre on the train home tomorrow, youíre soóî

But what they were, they didnít find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.

ìNow what am I going to do?î she asked shrilly.

ìThatís your problem,î said Ron. ìWeíve got to go, weíre going to be late.î

They hadnít even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.

ìIím coming with you,î she said.

ìYou are not.î

ìDíyou think Iím going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us Iíll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.î

ìYouíve got some nerveóî said Ron loudly.

ìShut up, both of you!î said Harry sharply. ìI heard something.î

It was a sort of snuffling.

ìMrs. Norris?î breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.

It wasnít Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.

ìThank goodness you found me! Iíve been out here for hours, I couldnít remember the new password to get in to bed.î

ìKeep your voice down, Neville. The passwordís ëPig snoutí but it wonít help you now, the Fat Ladyís gone off somewhere.î

ìHowís your arm?î said Harry.

ìFine,î said Neville, showing them. ìMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.î

ìGoodówell, look, Neville, weíve got to be somewhere, weíll see you lateróî

ìDonít leave me!î said Neville, scrambling to his feet, ìI donít want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baronís been past twice already.î

Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.

ìIf either of you get us caught, Iíll never rest until Iíve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.î

Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.

They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.

Malfoy and Crabbe werenít there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.

ìHeís late, maybe heís chickened out,î Ron whispered.

Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnít Malfoy.

ìSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.î

It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filchís voice. Nevilleís robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.

ìTheyíre in here somewhere,î they heard him mutter, ìprobably hiding.î

ìThis way!î Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.

ìRUN!î Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was followingóthey swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were goingóthey ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.

ìI think weíve lost him,î Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.

ìIótoldóyou,î Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, ìIótoldóyou.î

ìWeíve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,î said Ron, ìquickly as possible.î

ìMalfoy tricked you,î Hermione said to Harry. ìYou realize that, donít you? He was never going to meet youóFilch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.î

Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasnít going to tell her that.

ìLetís go.î

It wasnít going to be that simple. They hadnít gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.

It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.

ìShut up, Peevesópleaseóyouíll get us thrown out.î

Peeves cackled.

ìWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, youíll get caughty.î

ìNot if you donít give us away, Peeves, please.î

ìShould tell Filch, I should,î said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. ìItís for your own good, you know.î

ìGet out of the way,î snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.

ìSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!î Peeves bellowed, ìSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDORóî

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a dooróand it was locked.

ìThis is it!î Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, ìWeíre done for! This is the end!î They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peevesís shouts.

ìOh, move over,î Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harryís wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, ìAlohomora!î

The lock clicked and the door swung openóthey piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.

ìWhich way did they go, Peeves?î Filch was saying. ìQuick, tell me.î

ìSay ëplease.íî

ìDonít mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?î

ìShanít say nothing if you donít say please,î said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.

ìAll rightóplease.î

ìNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldnít say nothing if you didnít say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!î And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.

ìHe thinks this door is locked,î Harry whispered. ìI think weíll be okayóget off, Neville!î For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harryís bathrobe for the last minute. ìWhat?î

Harry turned aroundóand saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure heíd walked into a nightmareóthis was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.

They werenít in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.

They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they werenít already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.

Harry groped for the doorknobóbetween Filch and death, heíd take Filch.

They fell backwardóHarry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didnít see him anywhere, but they hardly caredóall they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didnít stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.

ìWhere on earth have you all been?î she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

ìNever mind thatópig snout, pig snout,î panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if heíd never speak again.

ìWhat do they think theyíre doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?î said Ron finally. ìIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.î

Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. ìYou donít use your eyes, any of you, do you?î she snapped. ìDidnít you see what it was standing on.î

ìThe floor?î Harry suggested. ìI wasnít looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.î

ìNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. Itís obviously guarding something.î

She stood up, glaring at them.

ìI hope youíre pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killedóor worse, expelled. Now, if you donít mind, Iím going to bed.î

Ron stared after her, his mouth open.

ìNo, we donít mind,î he said. ìYouíd think we dragged her along, wouldnít you.î

But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding somethingÖ What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hideóexcept perhaps Hogwarts.

It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.




10. HALLOWEEN


Malfoy couldnít believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.

ìItís either really valuable or really dangerous,î said Ron.

ìOr both,î said Harry.

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didnít have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.

Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.

Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.

As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyoneís attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:



DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.

It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I donít want everybody knowing youíve got a broomstick or theyíll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven oíclock for your first training session.

Professor McGonagall


Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.

ìA Nimbus Two Thousand!î Ron moaned enviously. ìIíve never even touched one.î

They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.

ìThatís a broomstick,î he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. ìYouíll be in for it this time, Potter, first years arenít allowed them.î

Ron couldnít resist it.

ìItís not any old broomstick,î he said, ìitís a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say youíve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?î Ron grinned at Harry. ìComets look flashy, but theyíre not in the same league as the Nimbus.î

ìWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldnít afford half the handle,î Malfoy snapped back. ìI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.î

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoyís elbow.

ìNot arguing, I hope, boys?î he squeaked.

ìPotterís been sent a broomstick, Professor,î said Malfoy quickly.

ìYes, yes, thatís right,î said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. ìProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?î

ìA Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,î said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoyís face. ìAnd itís really thanks to Malfoy here that Iíve got it,î he added.

Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoyís obvious rage and confusion. ìWell, itís true,î Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, ìIf he hadnít stolen Nevilleís Remembrall I woulnít be on the teamÖî

ìSo I suppose you think thatís a reward for breaking rules?î came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harryís hand.

ìI thought you werenít speaking to us?î said Harry.

ìYes, donít stop now,î said Ron, ìitís doing us so much good.î

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where heíd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.

ìWow,î Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harryís bedspread.

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.

As seven oíclock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Heíd never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feelingóhe swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.

ìHey, Potter, come down!î

Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.

ìVery nice,î said Wood, his eyes glinting. ìI see what McGonagall meantÖ you really are a natural. Iím just going to teach you the rules this evening, then youíll be joining team practice three times a week.î

He opened the crate. Inside were four different sized balls.

ìRight,î said Wood. ìNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if itís not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.î

ìThree Chasers,î Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.

ìThis ballís called the Quaffle,î said Wood. ìThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?î

ìThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,î Harry recited. ìSoóthatís sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isnít it?î

ìWhatís basketball?î said Wood curiously.

ìNever mind,î said Harry quickly.

ìNow, thereís another player on each side whoís called the Keeper. Iím Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.î

ìThree Chasers, one Keeper,î said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. ìAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?î He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.

ìIíll show you now,î said Wood. ìTake this.î

He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.

ìIím going to show you what the Bludgers do,î Wood said. ìThese two are the Bludgers.î

He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.

ìStand back,î Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harryís face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the airóit zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.

ìSee?î Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. ìThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. Thatís why you have two Beaters on each teamóthe Weasley twins are oursóitís their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. Soóthink youíve got all that?î

ìThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,î Harry reeled off.

ìVery good,î said Wood.

ìEróhave the Bludgers ever killed anyone?î Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.

ìNever at Hogwarts. Weíve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. Thatís you. And you donít have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgersóî

ìóunless they crack my head open.î

ìDonít worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the BludgersóI mean, theyíre like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.î

Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.

ìThis,î said Wood, ìis the Golden Snitch, and itís the most important ball of the lot. Itís very hard to catch because itís so fast and difficult to see. Itís the Seekerís job to catch it. Youíve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other teamís Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. Thatís why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for agesóI think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.

ìWell, thatís itóany questions?î

Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.

ìWe wonít practice with the Snitch yet,î said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, ìitís too dark, we might lose it. Letís try you out with a few of these.î

He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.

Harry didnít miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldnít carry on.

ìThat Quidditch cupíll have our name on it this year,î said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. ìI wouldnít be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadnít gone off chasing dragons.î

Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that heíd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.

On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since theyíd seen him make Nevilleís toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harryís partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadnít spoken to either of them since the day Harryís broomstick had arrived.

ìNow, donít forget that nice wrist movement weíve been practicing!î squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. ìSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, tooónever forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ësí instead of ëfí and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.î

It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to itóHarry had to put it out with his hat.

Ron, at the next table, wasnít having much more luck.

ìWingardium Leviosa!î he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.

ìYouíre saying it wrong,î Harry heard Hermione snap. ìItís Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ëgarí nice and long.î

ìYou do it, then, if youíre so clever,î Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, ìWingardium Leviosa!î

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.

ìOh, well done!î cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ìEveryone see here, Miss Grangerís done it!î

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.

ìItís no wonder no one can stand her,î he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, ìsheís a nightmare, honestly.î

Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her faceóand was startled to see that she was in tears.

ìI think she heard you.î

ìSo?î said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. ìShe mustíve noticed sheís got no friends.î

Hermione didnít turn up for the next class and wasnít seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girlsí bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.

Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledoreís chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, ìTrollóin the dungeonsóthought you ought to know.î

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.

There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledoreís wand to bring silence.

ìPrefects,î he rumbled, ìlead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!î

Percy was in his element.

ìFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, Iím a prefect!î

ìHow could a troll get in?î Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.

ìDonít ask me, theyíre supposed to be really stupid,î said Ron. ìMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.î

They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ronís arm.

ìIíve just thoughtóHermione.î

ìWhat about her?î

ìShe doesnít know about the troll.î

Ron bit his lip.

ìOh, all right,î he snapped. ìBut Percyíd better not see us.î

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girlsí bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.

ìPercy!î hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.

ìWhatís he doing?î Harry whispered. ìWhy isnít he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?î

ìSearch me.î

Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snapeís fading footsteps.

ìHeís heading for the third floor,î Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.

ìCan you smell something?î

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.

And then they heard itóa low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointedóat the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.

It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.

The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.

ìThe keys in the lock,î Harry muttered. ìWe could lock it in.î

ìGood idea,î said Ron nervously.

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasnít about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.

ìYes!î

Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stopóa high, petrified screamóand it was coming from the chamber theyíd just chained up.

ìOh, no,î said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.

ìItís the girlsí bathroom!î Harry gasped.

ìHermione!î they said together.

It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.

ìConfuse it!î Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.

ìOy, pea brain!î yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didnít even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.

ìCome on, run, run!î Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldnít move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.

Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trollís neck from behind. The troll couldnít feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harryís wand had still been in his hand when heíd jumpedóit had gone straight up one of the trollís nostrils.

Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.

Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wandónot knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: ìWingardium Leviosa!î

The club flew suddenly out of the trollís hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly overóand dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its ownerís head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.

Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.

It was Hermione who spoke first.

ìIs itódead?î

ìI donít think so,î said Harry, ìI think itís just been knocked out.î

He bent down and pulled his wand out of the trollís nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

ìUrghótroll boogers.î

He wiped it on the trollís trousers.

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadnít realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trollís roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.

Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harryís mind.

ìWhat on earth were you thinking of?î said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. ìYouíre lucky you werenít killed. Why arenít you in your dormitory?î

Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.

Then a small voice came out of the shadows.

ìPlease, Professor McGonagallóthey were looking for me.î

ìMiss Granger!î

Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.

ìI went looking for the troll because IóI thought I could deal with it on my ownóyou know, because Iíve read all about them.î

Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?

ìIf they hadnít found me, Iíd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didnít have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.î

Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasnít new to them.

ìWellóin that caseÖî said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, ìMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?î

Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.

ìMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,î said Professor McGonagall. ìIím very disappointed in you. If youíre not hurt at all, youíd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.î

Hermione left.

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

ìWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.î

They hurried out of the chamber and didnít speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.

ìWe should have gotten more than ten points,î Ron grumbled.

ìFive, you mean, once sheís taken off Hermioneís.î

ìGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,î Ron admitted. ìMind you, we did save her.î

ìShe might not have needed saving if we hadnít locked the thing in with her,î Harry reminded him.

They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.

ìPig snout,î they said and entered.

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said ìThanks,î and hurried off to get plates.

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you canít share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.




11. QUIDDITCH


As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didnít know which was worseópeople telling him heíd be brilliant or people telling him theyíd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.

It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didnít know how heíd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harryís first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldnít be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snapeís eye. He limped over. He hadnít seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.

ìWhatís that youíve got there, Potter?î

It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.

ìLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,î said Snape. ìGive it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.î

ìHeís just made that rule up,î Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. ìWonder whatís wrong with his leg?î

ìDunno, but I hope itís really hurting him,î said Ron bitterly.

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ronís Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (ìHow will you learn?î), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.

Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.

ìBetter you than me,î they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldnít refuse if there were other teachers listening.

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.

Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered insideóand a horrible scene met his eyes.

Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.

ìBlasted thing,î Snape was saying. ìHow are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?î

Harry tried to shut the door quietly, butó

ìPOTTER!î

Snapeís face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.

ìI just wondered if I could have my book back.î

ìGET OUT! OUT!î

Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.

ìDid you get it?î Ron asked as Harry joined them. ìWhatís the matter?î

In a low whisper, Harry told them what heíd seen.

ìYou know what this means?î he finished breathlessly. ìHe tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween! Thatís where he was going when we saw himóheís after whatever itís guarding! And Iíd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!î

Hermioneís eyes were wide.

ìNoóhe wouldnít, she said. ìI know heís not very nice, but he wouldnít try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.î

ìHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,î snapped Ron. ìIím with Harry. I wouldnít put anything past Snape. But whatís he after? Whatís that dog guarding?î

Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldnít sleep. He tried to empty his mindóhe needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hoursóbut the expression on Snapeís face when Harry had seen his leg wasnít easy to forget.

The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.

ìYouíve got to eat some breakfast.î

ìI donít want anything.î

ìJust a bit of toast,î wheedled Hermione.

ìIím not hungry.î

Harry felt terrible. In an hourís time heíd be walking onto the field.

ìHarry, you need your strength,î said Seamus Finnigan. ìSeekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.î

ìThanks, Seamus,î said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.

By eleven oíclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.

Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).

Wood cleared his throat for silence.

ìOkay, men,î he said.

ìAnd women,î said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

ìAnd women,î Wood agreed. ìThis is it.î

ìThe big one,î said Fred Weasley.

ìThe one weíve all been waiting for,î said George.

ìWe know Oliverís speech by heart,î Fred told Harry, ìwe were on the team last year.î

ìShut up, you two,î said Wood. ìThis is the best team Gryffindorís had in years. Weíre going to win. I know it.î

He glared at them all as if to say, ìOr else.î

ìRight. Itís time. Good luck, all of you.î

Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees werenít going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.

Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.

ìNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,î she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.

ìMount your brooms, please.î

Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.

ìAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindorówhat an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, tooóî

ìJORDAN!î

ìSorry, Professor.î

The Weasley twinsí friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.

ìAnd sheís really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Woodís, last year only a reserveóback to Johnson andóno, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goesóFlint flying like an eagle up thereóheís going to scóno, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffleóthatís Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field andóOUCHóthat must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a BludgeróQuaffle taken by the Slytherinsóthatís Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but heís blocked by a second Bludgerósent his way by Fred or George Weasley, canít tell whichónice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goesósheís really flyingódodges a speeding Bludgeróthe goal posts are aheadócome on, now, AngelinaóKeeper Bletchley divesómissesóGRYFFINDORS SCORE!î

Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.

ìBudge up there, move along.î

ìHagrid!î

Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.

ìBin watchiní from me hut,î said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, ìBut it isnít the same as beiní in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?î

ìNope,î said Ron. ìHarry hasnít had much to do yet.î

ìKept outta trouble, though, thatís somethiní,î said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.

Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Woodís game plan.

ìKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,î Wood had said. ìWe donít want you attacked before you have to be.î

When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleysí wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.

ìAll right there, Harry?î he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.

ìSlytherin in possession,î Lee Jordan was saying, ìChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward theówait a momentówas that the Snitch?î

A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.

Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.

Harry was faster than Higgsóhe could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up aheadóhe put on an extra spurt of speedó

WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors belowóMarcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harryís broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.

ìFoul!î screamed the Gryffindors.

Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, ìSend him off, ref! Red card!î

ìWhat are you talking about, Dean?î said Ron.

ìRed card!î said Dean furiously. ìIn soccer you get shown the red card and youíre out of the game!î

ìBut this isnít soccer, Dean,î Ron reminded him.

Hagrid, however, was on Deanís side.

ìThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.î

Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.

ìSoóafter that obvious and disgusting bit of cheatingóî

ìJordan!î growled Professor McGonagall.

ìI mean, after that open and revolting foulóî

ìJordan, Iím warning youóî

ìAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, Iím sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.î

It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. Heíd never felt anything like that.

It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-postsóhe had half a mind to ask Wood to call time outóand then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldnít turn it. He couldnít direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.

Lee was still commentating.

ìSlytherin in possessionóFlint with the Quaffleópasses Spinnetópasses Bellóhit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his noseóonly joking, ProfessoróSlytherins scoreóA noÖî

The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harryís broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.

ìDunno what Harry thinks heís doing,î Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. ìIf I didní know better, Iíd say heíd lost control of his broomÖ but he canít haveÖî

Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harryís broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.

ìDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?î Seamus whispered.

ìCanít have,î Hagrid said, his voice shaking. ìCanít nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magicóno kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.î

At these words, Hermione seized Hagridís binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.

ìWhat are you doing?î moaned Ron, gray faced.

ìI knew it,î Hermione gasped, ìSnapeólook.î

Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.

ìHeís doing somethingójinxing the broom,î said Hermione.

ìWhat should we do?î

ìLeave it to me.î

Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no goodóevery time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.

ìCome on, Hermione,î Ron muttered desperately.

Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didnít even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snapeís robes.

It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the rowóSnape would never know what had happened.

It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.

ìNeville, you can look!î Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagridís jacket for the last five minutes.

Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sickóhe hit the field on all foursócoughedóand something gold fell into his hand.

ìIíve got the Snitch!î he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.

ìHe didnít catch it, he nearly swallowed it,î Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no differenceóHarry hadnít broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the resultsóGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagridís hut, with Ron and Hermione.

ìIt was Snape,î Ron was explaining, ìHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldnít take his eyes off you.î

ìRubbish,î said Hagrid, who hadnít heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. ìWhy would Snape do somethiní like that?î

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.

ìI found out something about him,î he told Hagrid. ìHe tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever itís guarding.î

Hagrid dropped the teapot.

ìHow do you know about Fluffy?î he said.

ìFluffy?î

ìYeahóheís mineóbought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub lasí yearóI lent him to Dumbledore to guard theóî

ìYes?î said Harry eagerly.

ìNow, donít ask me anymore,î said Hagrid gruffly. ìThatís top secret, that is.î

ìBut Snapeís trying to steal it.î

ìRubbish,î said Hagrid again. ìSnapeís a Hogwarts teacher, heíd do nothiní of the sort.î

ìSo why did he just try and kill Harry?î cried Hermione.

The afternoonís events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.

ìI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, Iíve read all about them! Youíve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasnít blinking at all, I saw him!î

ìIím telliní yeh, yer wrong!î said Hagrid hotly. ìI doní know why Harryís broom acted like that, but Snape wouldní try aní kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yehóyer meddliní in things that doní concern yeh. Itís dangerous. You forget that dog, aní you forget what itís guardiní, thatís between Professor Dumbledore aní Nicolas Flamelóî

ìAha!î said Harry, ìso thereís someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?î

Hagrid looked furious with himself.




12. THE MIRROR OF ERISED


Christmas was coming. One morning in mid December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.

No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snapeís classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.

ìI do feel so sorry,î said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, ìfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because theyíre not wanted at home.î

He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then heíd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.

It was true that Harry wasnít going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didnít feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas heíd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.

ìHi, Hagrid, want any help?î Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.

ìNah, Iím all right, thanks, Ron.î

ìWould you mind moving out of the way?î came Malfoyís cold drawl from behind them. ìAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I supposeóthat hut of Hagridís must seem like a palace compared to what your familyís used to.î

Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.

ìWEASLEY!î

Ron let go of the front of Malfoyís robes.

ìHe was provoked, Professor Snape,î said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. ìMalfoy was insultiní his family.î

ìBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,î said Snape silkily. ìFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isnít more. Move along, all of you.î

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.

ìIíll get him,î said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoyís back, ìone of these days, Iíll get himóî

ìI hate them both,î said Harry, ìMalfoy and Snape.î

ìCome on, cheer up, itís nearly Christmas,î said Hagrid. ìTell yeh what, come with me aní see the Great Hall, looks a treat.î

So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.

ìAh, Hagrid, the last treeóput it in the far corner, would you?î

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.

ìHow many days you got left until yer holidays?î Hagrid asked.

ìJust one,î said Hermione. ìAnd that reminds meóHarry, Ron, weíve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.î

ìOh yeah, youíre right,î said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.

ìThe library?î said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. ìJust before the holidays? Bit keen, arenít yeh?î

ìOh, weíre not working,î Harry told him brightly. ìEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel weíve been trying to find out who he is.î

ìYou what?î Hagrid looked shocked. ìListen hereóIíve told yehódrop it. Itís nothiní to you what that dogís guardiní.î

ìWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, thatís all,î said Hermione.

ìUnless youíd like to tell us and save us the trouble?î Harry added. ìWe mustíve been through hundreds of books already and we canít find him anywhereójust give us a hintóI know Iíve read his name somewhere.î

ìIím sayiní nothiní,î said Hagrid flatly.

ìJust have to find out for ourselves, then,î said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.

They had indeed been searching books for Flamelís name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasnít in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.

Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasnít somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew heíd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.

ìWhat are you looking for, boy?î

ìNothing,î said Harry.

Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.

ìYouíd better get out, then. Go onóout!î

Wishing heíd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed theyíd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure sheíd be able to tell them, but they couldnít risk Snape hearing what they were up to.

Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasnít very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnít surprising theyíd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.

Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.

ìYou will keep looking while Iím away, wonít you?î said Hermione. ìAnd send me an owl if you find anything.î

ìAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,î said Ron. ìItíd be safe to ask them.î

ìVery safe, as theyíre both dentists,î said Hermione.

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting forkóbread, English muffins, marshmallowsóand plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnít work.

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ronís set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his familyóin this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen werenít a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.

Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didnít trust him at all. He wasnít a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. ìDonít send me there, canít you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.î

On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.

ìMerry Christmas,î said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.

ìYou, too,î said Harry. ìWill you look at this? Iíve got some presents!î

ìWhat did you expect, turnips?î said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harryís.

Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew itóit sounded a bit like an owl.

A second, very small parcel contained a note.



We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.


Taped to the note was a fifty pence piece.

ìThatís friendly,î said Harry.

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.

ìWeird!î he said, ìWhat a shape! This is money?î

ìYou can keep it,î said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. ìHagrid and my aunt and uncleóso who sent these?î

ìI think I know who that oneís from,î said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. ìMy mom. I told her you didnít expect any presents andóoh, no,î he groaned, ìsheís made you a Weasley sweater.î

Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.

ìEvery year she makes us a sweater,î said Ron, unwrapping his own, ìand mineís always maroon.î

ìThatís really nice of her,î said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.

His next present also contained candyóa large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.

This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.

Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.

ìIíve heard of those,î he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans heíd gotten from Hermione. ìIf thatís what I think it isótheyíre really rare, and really valuable.î

ìWhat is it?î

Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.

ìItís an Invisibility Cloak,î said Ron, a look of awe on his face. ìIím sure it isótry it on.î

Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.

ìIt is! Look down!î

Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.

ìThereís a note!î said Ron suddenly. ìA note fell out of it!î

Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:



Your father left this in my possession before he died.

It is time it was returned to you.

Use it well.

A Very Merry Christmas to you.


There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.

ìIíd give anything for one of these,î he said. ìAnything. Whatís the matter?î

ìNothing,î said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?

Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didnít feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.

ìMerry Christmas!î

ìHey, lookóHarryís got a Weasley sweater, too!î

Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.

ìHarryís is better than ours, though,î said Fred, holding up Harryís sweater. ìShe obviously makes more of an effort if youíre not family.î

ìWhy arenít you wearing yours, Ron?î George demanded. ìCome on, get it on, theyíre lovely and warm.î

ìI hate maroon,î Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.

ìYou havenít got a letter on yours,î George observed. ìI suppose she thinks you donít forget your name. But weíre not stupidówe know weíre called Gred and Forge.î

ìWhatís all this noise.î

Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.

ìP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, weíre all wearing ours, even Harry got one.î

ìIódonítówant,î said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.

ìAnd youíre not sitting with the prefects today, either,î said George. ìChristmas is a time for family.î

They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.

Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauceóand stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didnít just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiralís hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizardís hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harryís amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.

When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norrisís Christmas dinner.

Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldnít have lost so badly if Percy hadnít tried to help him so much.

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because theyíd stolen his prefect badge.

It had been Harryís best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as heíd drawn the curtains of his four poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.

His fatherísÖ this had been his fatherís. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.

He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.

Use it well.

Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.

Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him backóhis fatherís cloakóhe felt that this timeóthe first timeóhe wanted to use it alone.

He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.

ìWhoís there?î squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.

Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. Heíd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.

The library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.

The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.

They didnít tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldnít understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harryís neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldnít be.

He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silenceóthe book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outsideóstuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filchís pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filchís outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the bookís shrieks still ringing in his ears.

He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadnít paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didnít recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.

ìYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebodyís been in the library Restricted Section.î

Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, ìThe Restricted Section? Well, they canít be far, weíll catch them.î

Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldnít see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyíd knock right into himóthe cloak didnít stop him from being solid.

He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.

It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basketóbut propped against the wall facing him was something that didnít look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.

He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamedófor he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.

There he was, reflected in it, white and scared looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulderóbut still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrorís trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?

He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, heíd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only airóshe and the others existed only in the mirror.

She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyesóher eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright greenóexactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harryís did.

Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.

ìMom?î he whispered. ìDad?î

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harryís knobbly kneesóHarry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

How long he stood there, he didnít know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldnít stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his motherís face, whispered, ìIíll come back,î and hurried from the room.

ìYou could have woken me up,î said Ron, crossly.

ìYou can come tonight, Iím going back, I want to show you the mirror.î

ìIíd like to see your mom and dad,î Ron said eagerly.

ìAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, youíll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.î

ìYou can see them any old time,î said Ron. ìJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why arenít you eating anything?î

Harry couldnít eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didnít seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?

ìAre you all right?î said Ron. ìYou look odd.î

What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harryís route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.

ìIím freezing,î said Ron. ìLetís forget it and go back.î

ìNo!î Harry hissed. I know itís here somewhere.î

They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.

ìItís hereójust hereóyes!î

They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.

There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.

ìSee?î Harry whispered.

ìI canít see anything.î

ìLook! Look at them allÖ there are loads of themÖî

ìI can only see you.î

ìLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.î

Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldnít see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.

Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.

ìLook at me!î he said.

ìCan you see all your family standing around you?î

ìNoóIím aloneóbut Iím differentóI look olderóand Iím head boy!î

ìWhat?î

ìI amóIím wearing the badge like Bill used toóand Iím holding the house cup and the Quidditch cupóIím Quidditch captain, too.î

Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.

ìDo you think this mirror shows the future?î

ìHow can it? All my family are deadólet me have another lookóî

ìYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.î

ìYouíre only holding the Quidditch cup, whatís interesting about that? I want to see my parents.î

ìDonít push meóî

A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadnít realized how loudly they had been talking.

ìQuick!î

Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thingódid the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.

ìThis isnít safeóshe might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.î

And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.

The snow still hadnít melted the next morning.

ìWant to play chess, Harry?î said Ron.

ìNo.î

ìWhy donít we go down and visit Hagrid?î

ìNoÖ you goÖî

ìI know what youíre thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Donít go back tonight.î

ìWhy not?î

ìI dunno, Iíve just got a bad feeling about itóand anyway, youíve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they canít see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?î

ìYou sound like Hermione.î

ìIím serious, Harry, donít go.î

But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasnít going to stop him.

That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didnít meet anyone.

And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.

Exceptó

ìSoóback again, Harry?î

Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnít noticed him.

ìóI didnít see you, sir.î

ìStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,î said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.

ìSo,î said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, ìyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.î

ìI didnít know it was called that, sir.î

ìBut I expect youíve realized by now what it does?î

ìItówellóit shows me my familyóî

ìAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.î

ìHow did you knowó?î

ìI donít need a cloak to become invisible,î said Dumbledore gently. ìNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?î

Harry shook his head.

ìLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?î

Harry thought. Then he said slowly, ìIt shows us what we wantÖ whatever we wantÖî

ìYes and no,î said Dumbledore quietly. ìIt shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.

ìThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why donít you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?î

Harry stood up.

ìSiróProfessor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?î

ìObviously, youíve just done so,î Dumbledore smiled. ìYou may ask me one more thing, however.î

ìWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?î

ìI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.î

Harry stared.

ìOne can never have enough socks,î said Dumbledore. ìAnother Christmas has come and gone and I didnít get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.î

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.




13. NICOLAS FLAMEL


Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what heíd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldnít. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.

ìYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,î said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.

Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (ìIf Filch had caught you!î), and disappointment that he hadnít at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.

They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure heíd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.

Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnít dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Woodís side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.

Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. Heíd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.

ìWill you stop messing around!î he yelled. ìThatís exactly the sort of thing thatíll lose us the match! Snapeís refereeing this time, and heíll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!î

George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.

ìSnapeís refereeing?î he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. ìWhenís he ever refereed a Quidditch match? Heís not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.î

The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.

ìItís not my fault,î said Wood. ìWeíve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasnít got an excuse to pick on us.î

Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing QuidditchÖ

The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.

ìDonít talk to me for a moment,î said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, ìI need to concenóî He caught sight of Harryís face. ìWhatís the matter with you? You look terrible.î

Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snapeís sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.

ìDonít play,î said Hermione at once.

ìSay youíre ill,î said Ron.

ìPretend to break your leg,î Hermione suggested.

ìReally break your leg,î said Ron.

ìI canít,î said Harry. ìThere isnít a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor canít play at all.î

At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyoneís guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.

Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Nevilleís legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. ìWhat happened?î Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.

ìMalfoy,î said Neville shakily. ìI met him outside the library. He said heíd been looking for someone to practice that on.î

ìGo to Professor McGonagall!î Hermione urged Neville. ìReport him!î

Neville shook his head.

ìI donít want more trouble,î he mumbled.

ìYouíve got to stand up to him, Neville!î said Ron. ìHeís used to walking all over people, but thatís no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.î

ìThereís no need to tell me Iím not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoyís already done that,î Neville choked out.

Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.

ìYouíre worth twelve of Malfoy,î Harry said. ìThe Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didnít it? And whereís Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.î

Nevilleís lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.

ìThanks, HarryÖ I think Iíll go to bedÖ Díyou want the card, you collect them, donít you?î

As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.

ìDumbledore again,î he said, ìHe was the first one I everóî

He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.

ìIíve found him!î he whispered. ìIíve found Flamel! I told you Iíd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming hereólisten to this: ëDumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragonís blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamelí!î

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadnít looked so excited since theyíd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.

ìStay there!î she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girlsí dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.

ìI never thought to look in here!î she whispered excitedly. ìI got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.î

ìLight?î said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until sheíd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.

At last she found what she was looking for.

ìI knew it! I knew it!î

ìAre we allowed to speak yet?î said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.

ìNicolas Flamel,î she whispered dramatically, ìis the only known maker of the Sorcererís Stone!î

This didnít have quite the effect sheíd expected.

ìThe what?î said Harry and Ron.

ìOh, honestly, donít you two read? Lookóread that, there.î

She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:



The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcererís Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.

There have been many reports of the Sorcererís Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).


ìSee?î said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. ìThe dog must be guarding Flamelís Sorcererís Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because theyíre friends and he knew someone was after it, thatís why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!î

ìA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!î said Harry. ìNo wonder Snapeís after it! Anyone would want it.î

ìAnd no wonder we couldnít find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,î said Ron. ìHeís not exactly recent if heís six hundred and sixty five, is he?î

The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what theyíd do with a Sorcererís Stone if they had one. It wasnít until Ron said heíd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.

ìIím going to play,î he told Ron and Hermione. ìIf I donít, all the Slytherins will think Iím just too scared to face Snape. Iíll show themÖ itíll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.î

ìJust as long as weíre not wiping you off the field,î said Hermione.

As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasnít too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?

Harry didnít know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know theyíd found out about the Sorcererís Stone? Harry didnít see how he couldóyet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.

Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether theyíd ever see him alive again. This wasnít what youíd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Woodís pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldnít understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg Locker Curse. Theyíd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.

ìNow, donít forget, itís Locomotor Mortis,î Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.

ìI know,î Ron snapped. ìDonít nag.î

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.

ìDonít want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch itís now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.î

ìThe whole schoolís out there!î said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. ìEvenóblimeyóDumbledoreís come to watch!î

Harryís heart did a somersault.

ìDumbledore?î he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.

Harry could have laughed out loud with reliefóHe was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.

Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.

ìIíve never seen Snape look so mean,î he told Hermione. ìLook theyíre offóOuch!î

Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.

ìOh, sorry, Weasley, didnít see you there.î

Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.

ìWonder how long Potterís going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?î

Ron didnít answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.

ìYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?î said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. ìItís people they feel sorry for. See, thereís Potter, whoís got no parents, then thereís the Weasleys, whoíve got no moneyóyou should be on the team, Longbottom, youíve got no brains.î

Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.

ìIím worth twelve of you, Malfoy,î he stammered.

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, ìYou tell him, Neville.î

ìLongbottom, if brains were gold youíd be poorer than Weasley, and thatís saying something.î

Ronís nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.

ìIím warning you, Malfoyóone more wordóî

ìRon!î said Hermione suddenly, ìHarryóî

ìWhat? Where?î

Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.

ìYouíre in luck, Weasley, Potterís obviously spotted some money on the ground!î said Malfoy.

Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.

ìCome on, Harry!î Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snapeóshe didnít even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inchesóthe next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.

The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.

ìRon! Ron! Where are you? The gameís over! Harryís won! Weíve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!î shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.

Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldnít believe it. Heíd done itóthe game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lippedóthen Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledoreís smiling face.

ìWell done,î said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. ìNice to see you havenít been brooding about that mirrorÖ been keeping busyÖ excellentÖî

Snape spat bitterly on the ground.

Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldnít ever remember feeling happier. Heíd really done something to be proud of nowóno one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.

Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. Heíd done it, heíd shown SnapeÖ

And speaking of SnapeÖ

A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harryís victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figureís prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinnerówhat was going on?

Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.

The trees were so thick he couldnít see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.

He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.

Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasnít alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldnít make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.

ìÖd-donít know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, SeverusÖî

ìOh, I thought weíd keep this private,î said Snape, his voice icy. ìStudents arenít supposed to know about the Sorcererís Stone, after all.î

Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.

ìHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagridís yet?î

ìB-b-but Severus, Ióî

ìYou donít want me as your enemy, Quirrell,î said Snape, taking a step toward him.

ìIóI donít know what youóî

ìYou know perfectly well what I mean.î

An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, ìóyour little bit of hocus pocus. Iím waiting.î

ìB-but I d-d-donítóî

ìVery well,î Snape cut in. ìWeíll have another little chat soon, when youíve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.î

He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.


* * *

ìHarry, where have you been?î Hermione squeaked.

ìWe won! You won! We won!î shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. ìAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed! Heís still out cold but Madam Pomftey says heíll be all rightótalk about showing Slytherin! Everyoneís waiting for you in the common room, weíre having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.î

ìNever mind that now,î said Harry breathlessly. ìLetís find an empty room, you wait ítil you hear thisÖî

He made sure Peeves wasnít inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what heíd seen and heard.

ìSo we were right, it is the Sorcererís Stone, and Snapeís trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffyóand he said something about Quirrellís ëhocus pocussíóI reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break throughóî

ìSo you mean the Stoneís only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?î said Hermione in alarm.

ìItíll be gone by next Tuesday,î said Ron.




14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK


Quirrell, however, must have been braver than theyíd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didnít look as though heíd cracked yet.

Every time they passed the third floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrellís stutter.

Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcererís Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldnít have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.

ìHermione, the exams are ages away.î

ìTen weeks,î Hermione snapped. ìThatís not ages, thatís like a second to Nicolas Flamel.î

ìBut weíre not six hundred years old,î Ron reminded her. ìAnyway, what are you studying for, you already know itís an A.î

ìWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? Theyíre very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I donít know whatís gotten into meÖî

Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays werenít nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragonís blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.

ìIíll never remember this,î Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day theyíd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget me not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.

Harry, who was looking up ìDittanyî in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didnít look up until he heard Ron say, ìHagrid! What are you doing in the library?î

Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.

ìJusí lookiní,î he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. ìAní whatíre you lot up ter?î He looked suddenly suspicious. ìYer not still lookiní fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?î

ìOh, we found out who he is ages ago,î said Ron impressively. ìAnd we know what that dogís guarding, itís a Sorcererís Stóî

ìShhhh!î Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. ìDoní go shoutiní about it, whatís the matter with yeh?î

ìThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,î said Harry, ìabout whatís guarding the Stone apart from Fluffyóî

ìSHHHH!î said Hagrid again. ìListenócome aní see me later, Iím not promisiní Iíll tell yeh anythiní, mind, but doní go rabbitiní about it in here, students arení sípposed ter know. Theyíll think Iíve told yehóî

ìSee you later, then,î said Harry.

Hagrid shuffled off.

ìWhat was he hiding behind his back?î said Hermione thoughtfully.

ìDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?î

ìIím going to see what section he was in,î said Ron, whoíd had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.

ìDragons!î he whispered. ìHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeperís Guide.î

ìHagridís always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,î said Harry.

ìBut itís against our laws,î said Ron. ìDragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocksí Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. Itís hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if weíre keeping dragons in the back gardenóanyway, you canít tame dragons, itís dangerous. You should see the burns Charlieís got off wild ones in Romania.î

ìBut there arenít wild dragons in Britain?î said Harry.

ìOf course there are,î said Ron. ìCommon Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles whoíve spotted them, to make them forget.î

ìSo what on earths Hagrid up to?î said Hermione.

When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeperís hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called ìWho is it?î before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.

It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.

ìSoóyeh wanted to ask me somethiní?î

ìYes,î said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. ìWe were wondering if you could tell us whatís guarding the Sorcererís Stone apart from Fluffy.î

Hagrid frowned at him.

ìOí course I canít,î he said. ìNumber one, I doní know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldní tell yeh if I could. That Stoneís here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta GringottsóI síppose yehíve worked that out aní all? Beats me how yeh even know abouí Fluffy.î

ìOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,î said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagridís beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. ìWe only wondered who had done the guarding, really.î Hermione went on. ìWe wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.î

Hagridís chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.

ìWell, I doní sípose it could hurt ter tell yeh thatÖ letís seeÖ he borrowed Fluffy from meÖ then some oí the teachers did enchantmentsÖ Professor SproutóProfessor FlitwickóProfessor McGonagallóî he ticked them off on his fingers, ìProfessor Quirrellóaní Dumbledore himself did somethiní, oí course. Hang on, Iíve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.î

ìSnape?î

ìYeahóyer not still on abouí that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, heís not about ter steal it.î

Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everythingóexcept, it seemed, Quirrellís spell and how to get past Fluffy.

ìYouíre the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, arenít you, Hagrid?î said Harry anxiously. ìAnd you wouldnít tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?î

ìNot a soul knows except me aní Dumbledore,î said Hagrid proudly.

ìWell, thatís something,î Harry muttered to the others. ìHagrid, can we have a window open? Iím boiling.î

ìCanít, Harry, sorry,î said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.

ìHagridówhatís that?î

But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.

ìAh,î said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, ìThatís erÖî

ìWhere did you get it, Hagrid?î said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. ìIt mustíve cost you a fortune.î

ìWon it,î said Hagrid. ìLasí night. I was down in the village haviní a few drinks aní got into a game oí cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.î

ìBut what are you going to do with it when itís hatched?î said Hermione.

ìWell, Iíve bin doiní some readiní,î said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. ìGot this outta the libraryóDragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profitóitís a bit outta date, oí course, but itís all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ícause their mothers breathe on I em, see, aní when it hatches, feed it on a bucket oí brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. Aní see hereóhow ter recognize diffírent eggsówhat I got thereís a Norwegian Ridgeback. Theyíre rare, them.î

He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didnít.

ìHagrid, you live in a wooden house,î she said.

But Hagrid wasnít listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.

So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.

ìWonder what itís like to have a peaceful life,î Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.

Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: Itís hatching.

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldnít hear of it.

ìHermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?î

ìWeíve got lessons, weíll get into trouble, and thatís nothing to what Hagridís going to be in when someone finds out what heís doingóî

ìShut up!î Harry whispered.

Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didnít like the look on Malfoyís face at all.

Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagridís with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.

ìItís nearly out.î He ushered them inside.

The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.

They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.

All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasnít exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.

It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.

ìIsnít he beautiful?î Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragonís head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.

ìBless him, look, he knows his mommy!î said Hagrid.

ìHagrid,î said Hermione, ìhow fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?î

Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his faceóhe leapt to his feet and ran to the window.

ìWhatís the matter?î

ìSomeone was lookiní through the gap in the curtainsóitís a kidóheís runniní back up ter the school.î

Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.

Malfoy had seen the dragon.

Something about the smile lurking on Malfoyís face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagridís darkened hut, trying to reason with him.

ìJust let him go,î Harry urged. ìSet him free.î

ìI canít,î said Hagrid. ìHeís too little. Heíd die.î

They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadnít been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.

ìIíve decided to call him Norbert,î said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. ìHe really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Whereís Mommy?î

ìHeís lost his marbles,î Ron muttered in Harryís ear.

ìHagrid,î said Harry loudly, ìgive it two weeks and Norbertís going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.î

Hagrid bit his lip.

ìIóI know I canít keep him forever, but I canít jusí dump him, I canít.î

Harry suddenly turned to Ron. ìCharlie,î he said.

ìYouíre losing it, too,î said Ron. ìIím Ron, remember?î

ìNoóCharlieóyour brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!î

ìBrilliant!î said Ron. ìHow about it, Hagrid?î

And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.

The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harryís Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagridís hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.

ìIt bit me!î he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. ìIím not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragonís the most horrible animal Iíve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, youíd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.î

There was a tap on the dark window.

ìItís Hedwig!î said Harry, hurrying to let her in. ìSheíll have Charlieís answer!î

The three of them put their heads together to read the note.



Dear Ron,

How are you? Thanks for the letteróIíd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it wonít be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustnít be seen carrying an illegal dragon.

Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while itís still dark.

Send me an answer as soon as possible.

Love,

Charlie


They looked at one another.

ìWeíve got the Invisibility Cloak,î said Harry. ìIt shouldnít be too difficultóI think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.î

It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbertóand Malfoy.

There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ronís bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didnít know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfreyówould she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbertís fangs were poisonous.

Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.

ìItís not just my hand,î he whispered, ìalthough that feels like itís about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit meóIíve told her it was a dog, but I donít think she believes me. I shouldnít have hit him at the Quidditch match, thatís why heís doing this.î

Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.

ìItíll all be over at midnight on Saturday,î said Hermione, but this didnít soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.

ìMidnight on Saturday!î he said in a hoarse voice. ìOh noóoh noóIíve just rememberedóCharlieís letter was in that book Malfoy took, heís going to know weíre getting rid of Norbert.î

Harry and Hermione didnít get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.

ìItís too late to change the plan now,î Harry told Hermione. ìWe havenít got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. Weíll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesnít know about that.î

They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.

ìI wonít let you in,î he puffed. ìNorbertís at a tricky stageónothiní I canít handle.î

When they told him about Charlieís letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.

ìAargh! Itís all right, he only got my bootójusí playiníóheís only a baby, after all.î

The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldnít come quickly enough.

They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadnít been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagridís hut because theyíd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where heíd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.

ìHeís got lots oí rats aní some brandy fer the journey,î said Hagrid in a muffled voice. ìAní Iíve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.î

From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.

ìBye bye, Norbert!î Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. ìMommy will never forget you!î

How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then anotheróeven one of Harryís shortcuts didnít make the work much easier.

ìNearly there!î Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.

Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.

Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.

ìDetention!î she shouted. ìAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare youóî

ìYou donít understand, Professor. Harry Potterís comingóheís got a dragon!î

ìWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come onóI shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!î

The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until theyíd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.

ìMalfoyís got detention! I could sing!î

ìDonít,î Harry advised her.

Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.

Charlieís friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness theyíd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.

At last, Norbert was goingÖ goingÖ gone.

They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragonóMalfoy in detentionówhat could spoil their happiness?

The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filchís face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.

ìWell, well, well,î he whispered, ìwe are in trouble.î

Theyíd left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.




15. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST


Things couldnít have been worse.

Filch took them down to Professor McGonagallís study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harryís brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldnít see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.

Had Harry thought that things couldnít have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.

ìHarry!î Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. ìI was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a dragóî

Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.

ìI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. Itís one oíclock in the morning. Explain yourselves.î

It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacherís question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.

ìI think Iíve got a good idea of whatís been going on,î said Professor McGonagall. ìIt doesnít take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. Iíve already caught him. I suppose you think itís funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?î

Harry caught Nevilleís eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnít true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering NevilleóHarry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.

ìIím disgusted,î said Professor McGonagall. ìFour students out of bed in one night! Iíve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentionsóyes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, itís very dangerousóand fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.î

ìFifty?î Harry gaspedóthey would lose the lead, the lead heíd won in the last Quidditch match.

ìFifty points each,î said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.

ìProfessorópleaseóî

ìYou canítóî

ìDonít tell me what I can and canít do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. Iíve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.î

A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, theyíd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?

Harry didnít sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldnít think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what theyíd done?

At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thereíd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.

From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didnít trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, ìThanks, Potter, we owe you one!î

Only Ron stood by him.

ìTheyíll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time theyíve been here, and people still like them.î

ìTheyíve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?î said Harry miserably.

ìWellóno,î Ron admitted.

It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werenít his business from now on. Heíd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.

ìResign?î Wood thundered. ìWhat goodíll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we canít win at Quidditch?î

But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldnít speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him ìthe Seeker.î

Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didnít have as bad a time as Harry, because they werenít as well known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.

Harry was almost glad that the exams werenít far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellionsÖ

Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harryís new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnít concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrellís voice.

ìNoónoónot again, pleaseóî

It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.

ìAll rightóall rightóî he heard Quirrell sob.

Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didnít think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrellís footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what heíd promised himself about not meddling.

All the same, heíd have gambled twelve Sorcererís Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his stepóQuirrell seemed to have given in at last.

Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what heíd heard.

ìSnapeís done it, then!î said Ron. ìIf Quirrellís told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spellóî

ìThereís still Fluffy, though,î said Hermione.

ìMaybe Snapeís found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,î said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. ìI bet thereís a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?î

The light of adventure was kindling again in Ronís eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.

ìGo to Dumbledore. Thatís what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves weíll be thrown out for sure.î

ìBut weíve got no proof!î said Harry. ìQuirrellís too scared to back us up. Snapeís only got to say he doesnít know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floorówho do you think theyíll believe, him or us? Itís not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledoreíll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldnít help us if his life depended on it, heís too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, heíll think. And donít forget, weíre not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. Thatíll take a lot of explaining.î

Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didnít.

ìIf we just do a bit of poking aroundóî

ìNo,î said Harry flatly, ìweíve done enough poking around.î

He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.

The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:



Your detention will take place at eleven oíclock tonight.

Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.

Professor McGonagall


Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyíd lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didnít say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what theyíd got.

At eleven oíclock that night, they said good bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already thereóand so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.

ìFollow me,î said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.

ìI bet youíll think twice about breaking a school rule again, wonít you, eh?î he said, leering at them. ìOh yesÖ hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask meÖ Itís just a pity they let the old punishments die outÖ hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, Iíve got the chains still in my office, keep íem well oiled in case theyíre ever neededÖ Right, off we go, and donít think of running off, now, itíll be worse for you if you do.î

They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldnít be sounding so delighted.

The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagridís hut. Then they heard a distant shout.

ìIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.î

Harryís heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldnít be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, ìI suppose you think youíll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boyóitís into the forest youíre going and Iím much mistaken if youíll all come out in one piece.î

At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.

ìThe forest?î he repeated, and he didnít sound quite as cool as usual. ìWe canít go in there at nightóthereís all sorts of things in thereówerewolves, I heard.î

Neville clutched the sleeve of Harryís robe and made a choking noise.

ìThatís your problem, isnít it?î said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. ìShouldíve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldnít you?î

Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.

ìAbouí time,î he said. ìI bin waitiní fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?î

ìI shouldnít be too friendly to them, Hagrid,î said Filch coldly, ìtheyíre here to be punished, after all.î

ìThatís why yer late, is it?î said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. ìBin lecturiní them, eh? íSnot your place ter do that. Yehíve done yer bit, Iíll take over from here.î

ìIíll be back at dawn,î said Filch, ìfor whatís left of them,î he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.

Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.

ìIím not going in that forest,î he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.

ìYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,î said Hagrid fiercely. ìYehíve done wrong aní now yehíve got ter pay fer it.î

ìBut this is servant stuff, itís not for students to do. I thought weíd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, heídóî

ìótell yer thatís how it is at Hogwarts,î Hagrid growled. ìCopyiní lines! What goodís that ter anyone? Yehíll do summat useful or yehíll get out. If yeh think yer fatheríd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle aní pack. Go on.î

Malfoy didnít move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.

ìRight then,î said Hagrid, ìnow, listen carefully, ícause itís dangerous what weíre gonna do tonight, aní I doní want no one takiní risks. Follow me over here a moment.î

He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.

ìLook there,î said Hagrid, ìsee that stuff shininí on the ground? Silvery stuff? Thatís unicorn blood. Thereís a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. Weíre gonna try aní find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.î

ìAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?î said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.

ìThereís nothiní that lives in the forest thatíll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,î said Hagrid. ìAní keep ter the path. Right, now, weíre gonna split inter two parties aní follow the trail in diffírent directions. Thereís blood all over the place, it mustíve bin staggeriní around since last night at least.î

ìI want Fang,î said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fangís long teeth.

ìAll right, but I warn yeh, heís a coward,î said Hagrid. ìSo me, Harry, aní Hermioneíll go one way aní Draco, Neville, aní Fangíll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, weíll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out aní practice nowóthatís itóaní if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, aní weíll all come aní find yehóso, be carefulóletís go.î

The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.

They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves.

Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.

ìCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?î Harry asked.

ìNot fast enough,î said Hagrid. ìItís not easy ter catch a unicorn, theyíre powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.î

They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.

ìYou all right, Hermione?î Hagrid whispered. ìDoní worry, it canítíve gone far if itís this badly hurt, aní then weíll be able teróGET BEHIND THAT TREE!î

Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.

ìI knew it,î he murmured. ìThereís summat in here that shouldní be.î

ìA werewolf?î Harry suggested.

ìThat wasní no werewolf aní it wasní no unicorn, neither,î said Hagrid grimly. ìRight, follow me, but careful, now.î

They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.

ìWhoís there?î Hagrid called. ìShow yerselfóIím armed!î

And into the clearing cameówas it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horseís gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermioneís jaws dropped.

ìOh, itís you, Ronan,î said Hagrid in relief. ìHow are yeh?î

He walked forward and shook the centaurís hand.

ìGood evening to you, Hagrid,î said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. ìWere you going to shoot me?î

ìCanít be too careful, Ronan,î said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. ìThereís summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter aní Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. Aní this is Ronan, you two. Heís a centaur.î

ìWeíd noticed,î said Hermione faintly.

ìGood evening,î said Ronan. ìStudents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?î

ìErmóî

ìA bit,î said Hermione timidly.

ìA bit. Well, thatís something.î Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. ìMars is bright tonight.î

ìYeah,î said Hagrid, glancing up, too. ìListen, Iím glad weíve run inter yeh, Ronan, ícause thereís a unicorn bin hurtóyou seen anythiní?î

Ronan didnít answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.

ìAlways the innocent are the first victims,î he said. ìSo it has been for ages past, so it is now.î

ìYeah,î said Hagrid, ìbut have yeh seen anythiní, Ronan? Anythiní unusual?î

ìMars is bright tonight,î Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. ìUnusually bright.î

ìYeah, but I was meaniní anythiní unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. ìSo yeh havenít noticed anythiní strange?î

Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, ìThe forest hides many secrets.î

A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan.

ìHullo, Bane,î said Hagrid. ìAll right?î

ìGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?î

ìWell enough. Look, Iíve jusí bin askiní Ronan, you seen anythiní odd in here lately? Thereís a unicorn bin injuredówould yeh know anythiní about it?î

Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. ìMars is bright tonight,î he said simply.

ìWeíve heard,î said Hagrid grumpily. ìWell, if either of you do see anythiní, let me know, wonít yeh? Weíll be off, then.î

Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.

ìNever,î said Hagrid irritably, ìtry aní get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythiní closerín the moon.î

ìAre there many of them in here?î asked Hermione.

ìOh, a fair fewÖ Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but theyíre good enough about turniní up if ever I want a word. Theyíre deep mind, centaursÖ they know thingsÖ jusí doní let on much.î

ìDíyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier?î said Harry.

ìDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was whatís bin killiní the unicornsónever heard anythiní like it before.î

They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagridís arm.

ìHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!î

ìYou two wait here!î Hagrid shouted. ìStay on the path, Iíll come back for yeh!î

They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldnít hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.

ìYou donít think theyíve been hurt, do you?î whispered Hermione.

ìI donít care if Malfoy has, but if somethingís got NevilleÖ itís our fault heís here in the first place.î

The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harryís seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?

At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagridís return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.

ìWeíll be lucky ter catch anythiní now, with the racket you two were makiní. Right, weíre changiní groupsóNeville, you stay with me aní Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang aní this idiot. Iím sorry,î Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, ìbut heíll have a harder time frighteniní you, aní weíve gotta get this done.î

So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.

ìLookóî he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.

Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.

It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves.

Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quiveredÖ Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animalís side, and began to drink its blood.

ìAAAAAAAAAARGH!î

Malfoy let out a terrible scream and boltedóso did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harryóunicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harryóhe couldnít move for fear.

Then a pain like heíd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.

The pain in Harryís head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white blond hair and a palomino body.

ìAre you all right?î said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.

ìYesóthank youówhat was that?î

The centaur didnít answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harryís forehead.

ìYou are the Potter boy,î he said. ìYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this timeóespecially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.

ìMy name is Firenze,î he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.

There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.

ìFirenze!î Bane thundered. ìWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?î

ìDo you realize who this is?î said Firenze. ìThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.î

ìWhat have you been telling him?î growled Bane. ìRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?î

Ronan pawed the ground nervously. ìIím sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,î he said in his gloomy voice.

Bane kicked his back legs in anger.

ìFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!î

Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.

ìDo you not see that unicorn?î Firenze bellowed at Bane. ìDo you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.î

And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.

Harry didnít have a clue what was going on.

ìWhyís Bane so angry?î he asked. ìWhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?î

Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches, but did not answer Harryís question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didnít want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.

ìHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?î

ìNo,î said Harry, startled by the odd question. ìWeíve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.î

ìThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,î said Firenze. ìOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.î

Harry stared at the back of Firenzeís head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.

ìBut whoíd be that desperate?î he wondered aloud. ìIf youíre going to be cursed forever, deathís better, isnít it?î

ìIt is,î Firenze agreed, ìunless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something elseósomething that will bring you back to full strength and powerósomething that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?î

ìThe Sorcererís Stone! Of courseóthe Elixir of Life! But I donít understand whoóî

ìCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?î

It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harryís heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: ìSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.î

ìDo you mean,î Harry croaked, ìthat was Volóî

ìHarry! Harry, are you all right?î

Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.

ìIím fine,î said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. ìThe unicornís dead, Hagrid, itís in that clearing back there.î

ìThis is where I leave you,î Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. ìYou are safe now.î

Harry slid off his back.

ìGood luck, Harry Potter,î said Firenze. ìThe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.î

He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.

Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.

Harry couldnít sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.

ìSnape wants the stone for VoldemortÖ and Voldemortís waiting in the forestÖ and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get richÖî

ìStop saying the name!î said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.

Harry wasnít listening.

ìFirenze saved me, but he shouldnít have done soÖ Bane was furiousÖ he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happenÖ They must show that Voldemortís coming backÖ Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill meÖ I suppose thatís written in the stars as well.î

ìWill you stop saying the name!î Ron hissed.

ìSo all Iíve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,î Harry went on feverishly, ìthen Voldemort will be able to come and finish me offÖ Well, I suppose Baneíll be happy.î

Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.

ìHarry, everyone says Dumbledoreís the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who wonít touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says thatís a very imprecise branch of magic.î

The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the nightís surprises werenít over.

When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:



Just in case.





16. THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR


In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.

It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.

They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffboxópoints were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.

Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldnít sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.

Maybe it was because they hadnít seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didnít have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didnít seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didnít keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didnít have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.

Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whoíd invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyíd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldnít help cheering with the rest.

ìThat was far easier than I thought it would be,î said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. ìI neednít have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.î

Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. ìNo more studying,î Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. ìYou could look more cheerful, Harry, weíve got a week before we find out how badly weíve done, thereís no need to worry yet.î

Harry was rubbing his forehead.

ìI wish I knew what this means!î he burst out angrily. ìMy scar keeps hurtingóitís happened before, but never as often as this.î

ìGo to Madam Pomfrey,î Hermione suggested.

ìIím not ill,î said Harry. ìI think itís a warningÖ it means dangerís comingÖî

Ron couldnít get worked up, it was too hot.

ìHarry, relax, Hermioneís right, the Stoneís safe as long as Dumbledoreís around. Anyway, weíve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, heís not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.î

Harry nodded, but he couldnít shake off a lurking feeling that there was something heíd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, ìThatís just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered weíd done that one.î

Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnít have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past FluffyÖ neverÖ butÖ

Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.

ìWhereíre you going?î said Ron sleepily.

ìIíve just thought of something,î said Harry. He had turned white. ìWeíve got to go and see Hagrid, now.î

ìWhy?î panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.

ìDonít you think itís a bit odd,î said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, ìthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if itís against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, donít you think? Why didnít I see it before?î

ìWhat are you talking about?î said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didnít answer.

Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.

ìHullo,î he said, smiling. ìFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?î

ìYes, please,î said Ron, but Harry cut him off.

ìNo, weíre in a hurry. Hagrid, Iíve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?î

ìDunno,î said Hagrid casually, ìhe wouldní take his cloak off.î

He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.

ìItís not that unusual, yeh get a lot oí funny folk in the Hogís Headóthatís the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightní he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.î

Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. ìWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?î

ìMighta come up,î said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. ìYeahÖ he asked what I did, aní I told him I was gamekeeper hereÖ He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took afterÖ so I told himÖ aní I said what Iíd always really wanted was a dragonÖ aní thenÖ I caní remember too well, ícause he kept buyiní me drinksÖ Letís seeÖ yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg aní we could play cards fer it if I wantedÖ but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didní want it ter go ter any old homeÖ So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easyÖî

ìAnd did heódid he seem interested in Fluffy?î Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.

ìWellóyeahóhow many three headed dogs díyeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffyís a piece oí cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jusí play him a bit oí music aní heíll go straight off ter sleepóî

Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.

ìI shouldníta told yeh that!î he blurted out. ìForget I said it! Heyówhereíre yeh goiní?î

Harry, Ron, and Hermione didnít speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.

ìWeíve got to go to Dumbledore,î said Harry. ìHagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloakóit mustíve been easy, once heíd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesnít stop him. Whereís Dumbledoreís office?î

They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.

ìWeíll just have toóî Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.

ìWhat are you three doing inside?î

It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.

ìWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,î said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.

ìSee Professor Dumbledore?î Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. ìWhy?î

Harry swallowedónow what?

ìItís sort of secret,î he said, but he wished at once he hadnít, because Professor McGonagallís nostrils flared.

ìProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,î she said coldly. ìHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.î

ìHeís gone?î said Harry frantically. ìNow?î

ìProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his timeóî

ìBut this is important.î

ìSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?î

ìLook,î said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, ìProfessoróitís about the Sorcererís stoneóî

Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasnít that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didnít pick them up. ìHow do you know ?î she spluttered.

ìProfessor, I thinkóI knowóthat Snóthat someoneís going to try and steal the Stone. Iíve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.î

She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.

ìProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,î she said finally. ìI donít know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, itís too well protected.î

ìBut Professoróî

ìPotter, I know what Iím talking about,î she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. ìI suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.î

But they didnít.

ìItís tonight,î said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. ìSnapeís going through the trapdoor tonight. Heís found out everything he needs, and now heís got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.î

ìBut what can weóî

Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.

Snape was standing there.

ìGood afternoon,î he said smoothly.

They stared at him.

ìYou shouldnít be inside on a day like this,î he said, with an odd, twisted smile.

ìWe wereóî Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.

ìYou want to be more careful,î said Snape. ìHanging around like this, people will think youíre up to something. And Gryffindor really canít afford to lose any more points, can it?î

Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.

ìBe warned, Potteróany more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.î

He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.

Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.

ìRight, hereís what weíve got to do,î he whispered urgently. ìOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snapeówait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, youíd better do that.î

ìWhy me?î

ìItís obvious,î said Ron. ìYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.î He put on a high voice, ìëOh Professor Flitwick, Iím so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrongÖíî

ìOh, shut up,î said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.

ìAnd weíd better stay outside the third floor corridor,î Harry told Ron. ìCome on.î

But that part of the plan didnít work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.

ìI suppose you think youíre harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!î she stormed. ìEnough of this nonsense! If I hear youíve come anywhere near here again, Iíll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!î

Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, ìAt least Hermioneís on Snapeís tail,î when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.

ìIím sorry, Harry!î she wailed. ìSnape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and Iíve only just got away, I donít know where Snape went.î

ìWell, thatís it then, isnít it?î Harry said.

The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.

ìIím going out of here tonight and Iím going to try and get to the Stone first.î

ìYouíre mad!î said Ron.

ìYou canít!î said Hermione. ìAfter what McGonagall and Snape have said? Youíll be expelled!î

ìSO WHAT?î Harry shouted. ìDonít you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemortís coming back! Havenít you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There wonít be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! Heíll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesnít matter anymore, canít you see? Díyou think heíll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, Iíll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, itís only dying a bit later than I would have, because Iím never going over to the Dark Side! Iím going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?î

He glared at them.

ìYouíre right, Harry,î said Hermione in a small voice.

ìIíll use the Invisibility Cloak,î said Harry. ìItís just lucky I got it back.î

ìBut will it cover all three of us?î said Ron.

ìAllóall three of us?î

ìOh, come off it, you donít think weíd let you go alone?î

ìOf course not,î said Hermione briskly. ìHow do you think youíd get to the Stone without us? Iíd better go and took through my books, there might be something usefulÖî

ìBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.î

ìNot if I can help it,î said Hermione grimly. ìFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. Theyíre not throwing me out after that.î

After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadnít been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didnít talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.

Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.

ìBetter get the cloak,î Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffyóhe didnít feel much like singing.

He ran back down to the common room.

ìWeíd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of usóif Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its ownóî

ìWhat are you doing?î said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though heíd been making another bid for freedom.

ìNothing, Neville, nothing,î said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.

Neville stared at their guilty faces.

ìYouíre going out again,î he said.

ìNo, no, no,î said Hermione. ìNo, weíre not. Why donít you go to bed, Neville?î

Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldnít afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.

ìYou canít go out,î said Neville, ìyouíll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.î

ìYou donít understand,î said Harry, ìthis is important.î

But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.

ìI wonít let you do it,î he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. ìIíllóIíll fight you!î

ìNeville,î Ron exploded, ìget away from that hole and donít be an idiotóî

ìDonít you call me an idiot!î said Neville. ìI donít think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!î

ìYes, but not to us,î said Ron in exasperation. ìNeville, you donít know what youíre doing.î

He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.

ìGo on then, try and hit me!î said Neville, raising his fists. ìIím ready!î

Harry turned to Hermione.

ìDo something,î he said desperately.

Hermione stepped forward.

ìNeville,î she said, ìIím really, really sorry about this.î

She raised her wand.

ìPetrificus Totalus!î she cried, pointing it at Neville.

Nevilleís arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.

Hermione ran to turn him over. Nevilleís jaws were jammed together so he couldnít speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.

ìWhatíve you done to him?î Harry whispered.

ìItís the full Body Bind,î said Hermione miserably. ìOh, Neville, Iím so sorry.î

ìWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,î said Harry.

ìYouíll understand later, Neville,î said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.

But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didnít feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statueís shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.

ìOh, letís kick her, just this once,î Ron whispered in Harryís ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didnít do anything.

They didnít meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.

ìWhoís there?î he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. ìKnow youíre there, even if I canít see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?î

He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.

ìShould call Filch, I should, if somethingís a creeping around unseen.î

Harry had a sudden idea.

ìPeeves,î he said, in a hoarse whisper, ìthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.î

Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.

ìSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,î he said greasily. ìMy mistake, my mistakeóI didnít see youóof course I didnít, youíre invisibleóforgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.î

ìI have business here, Peeves,î croaked Harry. ìStay away from this place tonight.î

ìI will, sir, I most certainly will,î said Peeves, rising up in the air again. ìHope your business goes well, Baron, Iíll not bother you.î

And he scooted off.

ìBrilliant, Harry!î whispered Ron.

A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third floor corridoróand the door was already ajar.

ìWell, there you are,î Harry said quietly, ìSnapeís already got past Fluffy.î

Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.

ìIf you want to go back, I wonít blame you,î he said. ìYou can take the cloak, I wonít need it now.î

ìDonít be stupid,î said Ron.

ìWeíre coming,î said Hermione.

Harry pushed the door open.

As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dogís noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldnít see them.

ìWhatís that at its feet?î Hermione whispered.

ìLooks like a harp,î said Ron. ìSnape must have left it there.î

ìIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,î said Harry. ìWell, here goesÖî

He put Hagridís flute to his lips and blew. It wasnít really a tune, but from the first note the beastís eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dogís growls ceasedóit tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.

ìKeep playing,î Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dogís hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. ìI think weíll be able to pull the door open,î said Ron, peering over the dogís back. ìWant to go first, Hermione?î

ìNo, I donít!î

ìAll right.î Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogís legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.

ìWhat can you see?î Hermione said anxiously.

ìNothingójust blackóthereís no way of climbing down, weíll just have to drop.î

Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.

ìYou want to go first? Are you sure?î said Ron. ìI donít know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.î

Harry handed the flute over. In the few secondsí silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.

Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.

He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, ìIf anything happens to me, donít follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?î

ìRight,î said Ron.

ìSee you in a minute, I hopeÖî

And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down andó

FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.

ìItís okay!î he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, ìitís a soft landing, you can jump!î

Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.

ìWhatís this stuff?î were his first words.

ìDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose itís here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!î

The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harryís other side.

ìWe must be miles under the school,î she said.

ìLucky this plant thingís here, really,î said Ron.

ìLucky!î shrieked Hermione. ìLook at you both!î

She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.

Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.

ìStop moving!î Hermione ordered them. ìI know what this isóitís Devilís Snare!î

ìOh, Iím so glad we know what itís called, thatís a great help,î snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. ìShut up, Iím trying to remember how to kill it!î said Hermione.

ìWell, hurry up, I canít breathe!î Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.

ìDevilís Snare, Devilís SnareÖ what did Professor Sprout say?óit likes the dark and the dampóî

ìSo light a fire!î Harry choked.

ìYesóof courseóbut thereís no wood!î Hermione cried, wringing her hands.

ìHAVE YOU GONE MAD?î Ron bellowed. ìARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?î

ìOh, right!î said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.

ìLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,î said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.

ìYeah,î said Ron, ìand lucky Harry doesnít lose his head in a crisisóëthereís no wood,í honestly.î

ìThis way,î said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.

All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizardsí bank. If they met a dragon, a fully grown dragonóNorbert had been bad enoughÖ

ìCan you hear something?î Ron whispered.

Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.

ìDo you think itís a ghost?î

ìI donít knowÖ sounds like wings to me.î

ìThereís light aheadóI can see something moving.î

They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.

ìDo you think theyíll attack us if we cross the room?î said Ron.

ìProbably,î said Harry. ìThey donít look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at onceÖ well, thereís no other choiceÖ Iíll run.î

He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.

The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldnít budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.

ìNow what?î said Ron.

ìThese birdsÖ they canít be here just for decoration,î said Hermione.

They watched the birds soaring overhead, glitteringóglittering?

ìTheyíre not birds!î Harry said suddenly. ìTheyíre keys! Winged keysólook carefully. So that must meanÖî he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. ìÖyesólook! Broomsticks! Weíve got to catch the key to the door!î

ìBut there are hundreds of them!î

Ron examined the lock on the door.

ìWeíre looking for a big, old fashioned oneóprobably silver, like the handle.î

They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.

Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didnít. After a minuteís weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.

ìThat one!î he called to the others. ìThat big oneóthereóno, thereówith bright blue wingsóthe feathers are all crumpled on one side.î

Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.

ìWeíve got to close in on it!î Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. ìRon, you come at it from aboveóHermione, stay below and stop it from going down and Iíll try and catch it. Right, NOW!î

Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermioneís cheers echoed around the high chamber.

They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turnedóit worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.

ìReady?î Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.

The next chamber was so dark they couldnít see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.

They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightlyóthe towering white chessmen had no faces.

ìNow what do we do?î Harry whispered.

ìItís obvious, isnít it?î said Ron. ìWeíve got to play our way across the room.î

Behind the white pieces they could see another door.

ìHow?î said Hermione nervously.

ìI think,î said Ron, ìweíre going to have to be chessmen.î

He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knightís horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.

ìDo weóeróhave to join you to get across?î The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.

ìThis needs thinking about he said. I suppose weíve got to take the place of three of the black piecesÖî

Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, ìNow, donít be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chessóî

ìWeíre not offended,î said Harry quickly. ìJust tell us what to do.î

ìWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go next to him instead of that castle.î

ìWhat about you?î

ìIím going to be a knight,î said Ron.

The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.

ìWhite always plays first in chess,î said Ron, peering across the board. ìYesÖ lookÖî

A white pawn had moved forward two squares.

Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harryís knees were trembling. What if they lost?

ìHarryómove diagonally four squares to the right.î

Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.

ìHad to let that happen,î said Ron, looking shaken. ìLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.î

Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.

ìWeíre nearly there,î he muttered suddenly. ìLet me thinkólet me thinkÖî

The white queen turned her blank face toward him.

ìYesÖî said Ron softly, ìItís the only wayÖ Iíve got to be taken.î

ìNO!î Harry and Hermione shouted.

ìThatís chess!î snapped Ron. ìYouíve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and sheíll take meóthat leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!î

ìButóî

ìDo you want to stop Snape or not?î

ìRonóî

ìLook, if you donít hurry up, heíll already have the Stone!î

There was no alternative.

ìReady?î Ron called, his face pale but determined. ìHere I goónow, donít hang around once youíve won.î

He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the flooróHermione screamed but stayed on her squareóthe white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if heíd been knocked out.

Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.

The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harryís feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.

ìWhat if heísó?î

ìHeíll be all right,î said Harry, trying to convince himself. ìWhat do you reckonís next?î

ìWeíve had Sproutís, that was the Devilís Snare; Flitwick mustíve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrellís spell, and Snapeís.î

They had reached another door.

ìAll right?î Harry whispered.

ìGo on.î

Harry pushed it open.

A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.

ìIím glad we didnít have to fight that one,î Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. ìCome on, I canít breathe.î

He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came nextóbut there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.

ìSnapeís,î said Harry. ìWhat do we have to do?î

They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasnít ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.

ìLook!î Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:

		Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
		Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
		One among us seven will let you move ahead,
		Another will transport the drinker back instead,

		Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
		Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
		Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
		To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:

		First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
		You will always find some on nettle wineís left side;
		Second, different are those who stand at either end,
		But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;

		Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
		Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
		Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
		Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.

Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.

ìBrilliant,î said Hermione. ìThis isnít magicóitís logicóa puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards havenít got an ounce of logic, theyíd be stuck in here forever.î

ìBut so will we, wonít we?î

ìOf course not,î said Hermione. ìEverything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.î

ìBut how do we know which to drink?î

ìGive me a minute.î

Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.

ìGot it,î she said. ìThe smallest bottle will get us through the black fireótoward the Stone.î

Harry looked at the tiny bottle.

ìThereís only enough there for one of us,î he said. ìThatís hardly one swallow.î

They looked at each other.

ìWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?î

Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.

ìYou drink that,î said Harry. ìNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, theyíll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffyógo straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but Iím no match for him, really.î

ìBut Harryówhat if You-Know-Whoís with him?î

ìWellóI was lucky once, wasnít I?î said Harry, pointing at his scar. ìI might get lucky again.î

Hermioneís lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.

ìHermione!î

ìHarryóyouíre a great wizard, you know.î

ìIím not as good as you,î said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.

ìMe!î said Hermione. ìBooks! And cleverness! There are more important thingsófriendship and bravery andóoh Harryóbe careful!î

ìYou drink first,î said Harry. ìYou are sure which is which, arenít you?î

ìPositive,î said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.

ìItís not poison?î said Harry anxiously.

ìNoóbut itís like ice.î

ìQuick, go, before it wears off.î

ìGood luckótake care.î

ìGO!î

Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.

Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.

ìHere I come,î he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.

It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldnít feel themófor a moment he could see nothing but dark fireóthen he was on the other side, in the last chamber.

There was already someone thereóbut it wasnít Snape. It wasnít even Voldemort.




17. THE MAN WITH TWO FACES


It was Quirrell.

ìYou!î gasped Harry.

Quirrell smiled. His face wasnít twitching at all.

ìMe,î he said calmly. ìI wondered whether Iíd be meeting you here, Potter.î

ìBut I thoughtóSnapeóî

ìSeverus?î Quirrell laughed, and it wasnít his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. ìYes, Severus does seem the type, doesnít he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?î

Harry couldnít take it in. This couldnít be true, it couldnít.

ìBut Snape tried to kill me!î

ìNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and Iíd have got you off that broom. Iíd have managed it before then if Snape hadnít been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.î

ìSnape was trying to save me?î

ìOf course,î said Quirrell coolly. ìWhy do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didnít do it again. Funny, reallyÖ he neednít have bothered. I couldnít do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopularÖ and what a waste of time, when after all that, Iím going to kill you tonight.î

Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.

ìYouíre too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew youíd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.î

ìYou let the troll in?î

ìCertainly. I have a special gift with trollsóyou must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me offóand not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three headed dog didnít even manage to bite Snapeís leg off properly.

ìNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.î

It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.

ìThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,î Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. ìTrust Dumbledore to come up with something like thisÖ but heís in LondonÖ Iíll be far away by the time he gets backÖî

All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.

ìI saw you and Snape in the forestóî he blurted out.

ìYes,î said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. ìHe was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far Iíd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten meóas though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my sideÖî

Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.

ìI see the StoneÖ Iím presenting it to my masterÖ but where is it?î

Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didnít give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.

ìBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.î

ìOh, he does,î said Quirrell casually, ìheavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didnít you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.î

ìBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbingóI thought Snape was threatening youÖî

For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrellís face.

ìSometimes,î he said, ìI find it hard to follow my masterís instructionsóhe is a great wizard and I am weakóî

ìYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?î Harry gasped.

ìHe is with me wherever I go,î said Quirrell quietly. ìI met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek itÖ Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.î Quirrell shivered suddenly. ìHe does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished meÖ decided he would have to keep a closer watch on meÖî

Quirrellís voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? Heíd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.

Quirrell cursed under his breath.

ìI donít understandÖ is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?î

Harryís mind was racing.

What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding itówhich means Iíll see where itís hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what Iím up to?

He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.

ìWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!î

And to Harryís horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.

ìUse the boyÖ Use the boyÖî

Quirrell rounded on Harry.

ìYesóPotterócome here.î

He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.

ìCome here,î Quirrell repeated. ìLook in the mirror and tell me what you see.î

Harry walked toward him.

I must lie, he thought desperately.I must look and lie about what I see, thatís all.

Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrellís turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.

He saw his reflection, pale and scared looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocketóand as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehowóincrediblyóheíd gotten the Stone.

ìWell?î said Quirrell impatiently. ìWhat do you see?î

Harry screwed up his courage.

ìI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,î he invented. ìIóIíve won the house cup for Gryffindor.î

Quirrell cursed again.

ìGet out of the way,î he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcererís Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?

But he hadnít walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasnít moving his lips.

ìHe liesÖ He liesÖî

ìPotter, come back here!î Quirrell shouted. ìTell me the truth! What did you just see?î

The high voice spoke again.

ìLet me speak to himÖ face-to-faceÖî

ìMaster, you are not strong enough!î

ìI have strength enoughÖ for thisÖî

Harry felt as if Devilís Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldnít move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrellís head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.

Harry would have screamed, but he couldnít make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrellís head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.

ìHarry PotterÖî it whispered.

Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnít move.

ìSee what I have become?î the face said. ìMere shadow and vaporÖ I have form only when I can share anotherís bodyÖ but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and mindsÖ Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeksÖ you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forestÖ and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my ownÖ NowÖ why donít you give me that Stone in your pocket?î

So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harryís legs. He stumbled backward.

ìDonít be a fool,î snarled the face. ìBetter save your own life and join meÖ or youíll meet the same end as your parentsÖ They died begging me for mercyÖî

ìLIAR!î Harry shouted suddenly.

Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.

ìHow touchingÖî it hissed. ìI always value braveryÖ Yes, boy, your parents were braveÖ I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fightÖ but your mother neednít have diedÖ she was trying to protect youÖ Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.î

ìNEVER!î

Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed ìSEIZE HIM!î and the next second, Harry felt Quirrellís hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle sharp pain seared across Harryís scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessenedóhe looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingersóthey were blistering before his eyes.

ìSeize him! SEIZE HIM!î shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harryís neckóHarryís scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.

ìMaster, I cannot hold himómy handsómy hands!î

And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palmsóHarry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.

ìThen kill him, fool, and be done!î screeched Voldemort.

Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrellís faceó

ìAAAARGH!î

Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldnít touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible painóhis only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.

Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry offóthe pain in Harryís head was buildingóhe couldnít seeóhe could only hear Quirrellís terrible shrieks and Voldemortís yells of, ìKILL HIM! KILL HIM!î and other voices, maybe in Harryís own head, crying, ìHarry! Harry!î

He felt Quirrellís arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, downÖ downÖ downÖ

Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.

He blinked. It wasnít the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.

He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.

ìGood afternoon, Harry,î said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: ìSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! Heís got the Stone! Sir, quickóî

ìCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,î said Dumbledore. ìQuirrell does not have the Stone.î

ìThen who does? Sir, Ióî

ìHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.î

Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.

ìTokens from your friends and admirers,î said Dumbledore, beaming. ìWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.î

ìHow long have I been in here?î

ìThree days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.î

ìBut sit, the Stoneóî

ìI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.î

ìYou got there? You got Hermioneís owl?î

ìWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.î

ìIt was you.î

ìI feared I might be too late.î

ìYou nearly were, I couldnít have kept him off the Stone much longeróî

ìNot the Stone, boy, youóthe effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.î

ìDestroyed?î said Harry blankly. ìBut your friendóNicolas Flamelóî

ìOh, you know about Nicolas?î said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. ìYou did do the thing properly, didnít you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed itís all for the best.î

ìBut that means he and his wife will die, wonít they?î

ìThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.î

Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harryís face.

ìTo one as young as you, Iím sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above allóthe trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.î

Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.

ìSir?î said Harry. ìIíve been thinkingÖ siróeven if the Stoneís gone, Voló, I mean, You-Know-Whoóî

ìCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.î

ìYes, sir. Well, Voldemortís going to try other ways of coming back, isnít he? I mean, he hasnít gone, has he?î

ìNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to shareÖ not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next timeóand if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.î

Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, ìSir, there are some other things Iíd like to know, if you can tell meÖ things I want to know the truth aboutÖî

ìThe truth.î Dumbledore sighed. ìIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg youíll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.î

ìWellÖ Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?î

Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.

ìAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one dayÖ put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are olderÖ I know you hate to hear thisÖ when you are ready, you will know.î

And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.

ìBut why couldnít Quirrell touch me?î

ìYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didnít realize that love as powerful as your motherís for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible signÖ to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.î

Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, ìAnd the Invisibility Cloakódo you know who sent it to me?î

ìAhóyour father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.î Dumbledoreís eyes twinkled. ìUseful thingsÖ your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.î

ìAnd thereís something elseÖî

ìFire away.î

ìQuirrell said Snapeóî

ìProfessor Snape, Harry.î

ìYes, himóQuirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?î

ìWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.î

ìWhat?î

ìHe saved his life.î

ìWhat?î

ìYesÖî said Dumbledore dreamily. ìFunny, the way peopleís minds work, isnít it? Professor Snape couldnít bear being in your fatherís debtÖ I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your fatherís memory in peaceÖî

Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.

ìAnd sir, thereís one more thingÖî

ìJust the one?î

ìHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?î

ìAh, now, Iím glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, thatís saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stoneófind it, but not use itówould be able to get it, otherwise theyíd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimesÖ Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bottís Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then Iím afraid Iíve rather lost my liking for themóbut I think Iíll be safe with a nice toffee, donít you?î

He smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, ìAlas! Ear wax!î

Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.

ìJust five minutes,î Harry pleaded.

ìAbsolutely not.î

ìYou let Professor Dumbledore inÖî

ìWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.î

ìI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam PomfreyÖî

ìOh, very well,î she said. ìBut five minutes only.î

And she let Ron and Hermione in.

ìHarry!î

Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.

ìOh, Harry, we were sure you were going toóDumbledore was so worriedóî

ìThe whole schoolís talking about it,î said Ron. ìWhat really happened?î

It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrellís turban, Hermione screamed out loud.

ìSo the Stoneís gone?î said Ron finally. ìFlamelís just going to die?î

ìThatís what I said, but Dumbledore thinks thatówhat was it?óëto the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.íî

ìI always said he was off his rocker,î said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.

ìSo what happened to you two?î said Harry.

ìWell, I got back all right,î said Hermione. ìI brought Ron roundóthat took a whileóand we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hallóhe already knewóhe just said, ëHarryís gone after him, hasnít he?í and hurtled off to the third floor.î

ìDíyou think he meant you to do it?î said Ron. ìSending you your fatherís cloak and everything?î

ìWell,î Hermione exploded, ìif he didóI mean to say thatís terribleóyou could have been killed.î

ìNo, it isnít,î said Harry thoughtfully. ìHeís a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I donít think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. Itís almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I couldÖî

ìYeah, Dumbledoreís off his rocker, all right,î said Ron proudly. ìListen, youíve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of courseóyou missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without youóbut the foodíll be good.î

At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.

ìYouíve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,î she said firmly.

After a good nightís sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.

ìI want to go to the feast,î he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, canít I?î

ìProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,î she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didnít realize how risky feasts could be. ìAnd you have another visitor.î

ìOh, good,î said Harry. ìWho is it?î

Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.

ìItísóallómyóruddyófault!î he sobbed, his face in his hands. ìI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didnít know, aní I told him! Yeh couldíve died! All fer a dragon egg! Iíll never drink again! I should be chucked out aní made ter live as a Muggle!î

ìHagrid!î said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. ìHagrid, heíd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort weíre talking about, heíd have found out even if you hadnít told him.î

ìYeh couldíve died!î sobbed Hagrid. ìAní doní say the name!î

ìVOLDEMORT!î Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. ìIíve met him and Iím calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, itís gone, he canít use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, Iíve got loadsÖî

Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, ìThat reminds me. Iíve got yeh a present.î

ìItís not a stoat sandwich, is it?î said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.

ìNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. íCourse, he shoulda sacked me insteadóanyway, got yeh thisÖî

It seemed to be a handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.

ìSent owls off ter all yer parentsí old school friends, askiní fer photosÖ knew yeh didní have anyÖ díyeh like it?î

Harry couldnít speak, but Hagrid understood.

Harry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfreyís fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherinís winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.

When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.

Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.

ìAnother year gone!î Dumbledore said cheerfully. ìAnd I must trouble you with an old manís wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they wereÖ you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year startsÖ

ìNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.î

A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.

ìYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,î said Dumbledore. ìHowever, recent events must be taken into account.î

The room went very still. The Slytherinsí smiles faded a little.

ìAhem,î said Dumbledore. ìI have a few last minute points to dish out. Let me see. YesÖ

ìFirstóto Mr. Ronald WeasleyÖî

Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.

ìÖfor the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.î

Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, ìMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagallís giant chess set!î

At last there was silence again.

ìSecondóto Miss Hermione GrangerÖ for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.î

Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselvesóthey were a hundred points up.

ìThirdóto Mr. Harry PotterÖî said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet ìÖfor pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.î

The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two pointsóexactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cupóif only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.

Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.

ìThere are all kinds of courage,î said Dumbledore, smiling. ìIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.î

Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldnít have looked more stunned and horrified if heíd just had the Body Bind Curse put on him.

ìWhich means,î Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, ìwe need a little change of decoration.î

He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagallís hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harryís eye and Harry knew at once that Snapeís feelings toward him hadnít changed one jot. This didnít worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.

It was the best evening of Harryís life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trollsÖ he would never, ever forget tonight.

Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldnít have everything in life.

And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Nevilleís toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (ìI always hope theyíll forget to give us these,î said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bottís Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at Kingís Cross Station.

It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didnít attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.

ìYou must come and stay this summer,î said Ron, ìboth of youóIíll send you an owl.î

ìThanks,î said Harry, ìIíll need something to look forward to.î People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:

ìBye, Harry!î

ìSee you, Potter!î

ìStill famous,î said Ron, grinning at him.

ìNot where Iím going, I promise you,î said Harry.

He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. ìThere he is, Mom, there he is, look!î

It was Ginny Weasley, Ronís younger sister, but she wasnít pointing at Ron.

ìHarry Potter!î she squealed. ìLook, Mom! I can seeóî

ìBe quiet, Ginny, and itís rude to point.î

Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.

ìBusy year?î she said.

ìVery,î said Harry. ìThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.î

ìOh, it was nothing, dear.î

ìReady, are you?î

It was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.

ìYou must be Harryís family!î said Mrs. Weasley.

ìIn a manner of speaking,î said Uncle Vernon. ìHurry up, boy, we havenít got all day.î He walked away.

Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.

ìSee you over the summer, then.î

ìHope you haveóeróa good holiday,î said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.

ìOh, I will,î said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. ìThey donít know weíre not allowed to use magic at home. Iím going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summerÖî
